0	He came ashore at Laurentum, by the mouth of the river Numicius, where in obedience to some oracle he is said to have made preparations to dwell.
1	Thereupon Æneas founded a city which he named Lavinium and the country was called Latium and the people there were termed Latins.
2	Æneas vanished, being seen no more alive or dead, and was honored as a god by the Latins.
3	As time went on the Latin nation increased in size, and the majority of the people abandoned Lavinium to build another town in a better location.
4	So far the account concerns Lavinium and the people of Alba.
5	VII, When Numa died leaving no successor, Tullus Hostilius was chosen by the people and the senate.
6	He followed in the footsteps of Romulus, and both welcomed combats himself and encouraged the people to do the same.
7	So they, having armed themselves and having arrayed themselves in opposing files in the vacant space between the camps, called upon the same family gods and cast repeated glances upward at the sun.
8	But because he further killed his sister when she lamented on seeing Horatius carrying the spoils of her cousins, he was tried for murder; and having taken an appeal to the people he was released.
9	NOW AGAINST THE ENEMY TULLUS WAS THOUGHT TO BE VERY EFFICIENT, BUT HE NEGLECTED RELIGION. WHEN, HOWEVER, A PESTILENCE WAS
9	INCURRED AND HE HIMSELF FELL SICK, HE TURNED ASIDE TO A GODFEARING COURSE. He is said to have reached the end of his life by
9	son of Numa's daughter. being consumed by lightning or else as the result of a plot formed by Ancus Marcius, who happened to be as has been stated a

11	FOR BY USING HIS WEALTH QUITE LAVISHLY AND BY WINNING OVER THE NOBLES THROUGH HIS INTELLIGENCE AND WIT HE WAS INCLUDED AMONG
11	THE PATRICIANS AND IN THE SENATE BY MARCIUS, WAS APPOINTED PRÆTOR, AND WAS ENTRUSTED WITH THE SUPERVISION OF THE KING'S
11	CHILDREN AND OF THE KINGDOM. HE SHOWED HIMSELF AN EXCELLENT MAN, SHARING HIS MONEY WITH THOSE IN NEED AND BESTOWING HIS
11	SERVICES READILY IF ANY ONE NEEDED HIM TO HELP. HE NEITHER DID NOR SAID ANYTHING MEAN TO ANY ONE. IF HE RECEIVED A KINDNESS
11	FROM PERSONS HE MADE MUCH OF THE ATTENTION, WHEREAS IF ANY OFFENCE WAS OFFERED HIM, HE EITHER DISREGARDED THE INJURY OR
11	MINIMIZED IT AND MADE LIGHT OF IT, AND FAR FROM MAKING REPRISALS UPON THE MAN THAT HAD DONE THE INJURY, HE WOULD EVEN BENEFIT
11	MAN. But the aforesaid estimate of him did not continue permanently. HIM. THUS HE CAME TO DOMINATE BOTH MARCIUS HIMSELF AND HIS CIRCLE, AND ACQUIRED THE REPUTATION OF BEING A SENSIBLE AND UPRIGHT
12	The senate and the people were intending to elect the children of Marcius, when Tarquinius made advances to the most
12	influential of the senators; he had first sent the fatherless boys to some distant point on a hunting expedition and by his
12	when they had attained manhood. talk and his efforts he got these men to vote him the kingdom on the understanding that he would restore it to the children
13	As he still felt afraid in spite of being so placed, he secured some extra strength for himself in the senate.
14	Those of the populace who felt friendly towards him he enrolled to the number of about two hundred among the patricians and the senators, and thus he put both the senate and the people within his own control.
15	Tarquinius, seeing it, took an active interest in the child and on his arriving at maturity had him enrolled among the patricians and in the senate.
16	These were her words and the people not unwillingly accepted Tullius for he was thought to be an upright man.
17	BUT WHEN HE SAW THE PEOPLE OBEYING HIM IN ALL POINTS, he brought the assassins of Tarquinius before the senate, though, to be sure, only because of their plot; for he was still pretending that the king was still alive.
18	At first he put forward the children of Tarquinius as his excuse and caused it to be understood that he was the guardian of
18	multitude very much more easily than of the patricians. their royal office, but afterward he proceeded to pay court to the people, believing that he could secure control of the
19	Now since the patricians were disaffected in the matter of his aspirations and circulated among other sayings one to the effect that no one had chosen him to hold the sovereignty, he gathered the people and harangued them.
20	He in return bestowed many gifts upon them and enrolled some of them in the senate.
21	Meantime a Sabine brought to Rome an exceedingly fine cow, intending to sacrifice her to Minerva in accordance with an oracle.
22	The oracle said that he who should sacrifice her would enlarge his country.
23	When the Sabine made known the oracle the Latins both yielded the presidency of the shrine to the Romans and in other ways honored them as superior to themselves.
24	After persuading many of the senators and patricians whose reputations were under a cloud to coöperate with him against Tullius he unexpectedly repaired with them to the senate, his wife Tullia also following him.
25	When the latter on hearing of it hastily made his appearance and said a word or two, the pretender seized him, and thrusting him out cast him down the steps in front of the senatehouse.
26	Tarquin at once obtained the kingdom from the senate, and sent some men who despatched Tullius while he was on his way home.
27	The latter's daughter, after embracing her husband in the senatehouse and saluting him as king, departed to the palace and drove her chariot over the dead body of her father as he lay there.
28	AND WHEN HE HAD EQUIPPED HIMSELF TO RULE OVER THEM TYRANNICALLY HE ARRESTED AND PUT TO DEATH THE MOST POWERFUL MEMBERS OF THE
28	SENATE AND OF THE REST, EXECUTING PUBLICLY THOSE AGAINST WHOM HE WAS ABLE TO BRING A CHARGE, AND OTHERS SECRETLY; SOME ALSO HE
28	BANISHED. HE DESTROYED NOT MERELY THOSE WHO WERE ATTACHED TO THE PARTY OF TULLIUS, BUT IN ADDITION THOSE WHO HAD COÖPERATED
28	WITH HIM IN SECURING THE MONARCHY, AND THUS HE MADE AWAY WITH THE BEST PART OF THE SENATE AND OF THE KNIGHTS. HE UNDERSTOOD
28	THAT HE WAS HATED BY THE ENTIRE POPULACE; HENCE HE DID NOT APPOINT ANY PERSONS WHATEVER TO TAKE THE PLACES OF THOSE WHO KEPT
28	PERISHING, BUT UNDERTAKING TO ABOLISH THE SENATE ALTOGETHER HE DID NOT APPOINT A SINGLE NEW PERSON TO IT AND COMMUNICATED NO
28	NEWS OF IMPORTANCE TO THOSE WHO STILL WERE MEMBERS. HE CALLED THE SENATORS TOGETHER NOT TO HELP HIM IN THE ADMINISTRATION OF
28	ANY IMPORTANT MEASURES, BUT IN ORDER THAT THEIR FEWNESS MIGHT BE MADE EVIDENT TO ALL AND THEY BE CONSEQUENTLY DESPISED. MOST
28	OF HIS BUSINESS HE CARRIED ON BY HIMSELF OR WITH THE AID OF HIS SONS. IT WAS HARD TO APPROACH AND HARD TO ACCOST HIM, AND HE
28	SHOWED GREAT HAUGHTINESS AND BRUTALITY TOWARD ALL ALIKE, AND HE AS WELL AS HIS CHILDREN ADOPTED A MORE TYRANNICAL BEARING
28	Latin nation, intermingling the Latins with Romans in the ranks. TOWARD ALL PERSONS. Hence he also cast eyes of suspicion upon the members of his guard and secured a new bodyguard from the
29	He also joined battle with the people of Gabii and fared ill in the conflict, but by treachery overcame them; for he suggested to his son Sextus that he desert to their side.
30	Then, according to arrangement, the son made his treacherous desertion to the people of Gabii, taking along with him money and companions.
31	VII, The oracles of the Sibyl to the Romans he obtained even against his will.
32	But as Apollo declared that he should not be driven from his domain till a dog should use human speech, he was elated with hopes for the best, thinking that the oracle could never be fulfilled.
33	NOW LUCIUS JUNIUS WAS A SON OF TARQUIN'S SISTER; HIS FATHER AND BROTHER TARQUIN HAD KILLED. SO HE, FEARING FOR HIS OWN PERSON,
33	FEIGNED MADNESS, EMPLOYING THIS MEANS OF SAFETY AS A SCREEN FOR HIS LIFE. HENCE HE WAS DUBBED BRUTUS, FOR THIS IS THE NAME BY
33	WHICH THE LATINS ARE ACCUSTOMED TO CALL IDIOTS. WHILE PRETENDING TO BE MAD HE WAS TAKEN ALONG AS A PLAYTHING BY THE CHILDREN
33	APPARENTLY POSSESSING NO POINT OF EXCELLENCE, so that he became a laughing stock for it all the more. OF TARQUIN, WHEN THEY JOURNEYED TO DELPHI. AND HE SAID THAT HE WAS CARRYING A VOTIVE OFFERING TO THE GOD; THIS WAS A STAFF,
34	TO THE QUERY OF THE SONS OF TARQUIN AS TO WHO SHOULD SUCCEED TO THEIR FATHER'S SOVEREIGNTY THE GOD REPLIED THAT THE FIRST WHO
34	KISSED HIS MOTHER SHOULD OBTAIN THE POWER. AND BRUTUS, COMPREHENDING, FELL DOWN AS IF ACCIDENTALLY AND COVERED THE EARTH WITH
34	KISSES, RIGHTLY DEEMING HER TO BE THE MOTHER OF ALL. THIS BRUTUS OVERTHREW THE TARQUINS, taking as his justification the case
34	of Lucretia, though these rulers were even without that hated by all for their tyrannous and violent characteristics.
35	Lucretia was a daughter of Lucretius Spurius, a man that was a member of the senate, and she was wife of the distinguished Tarquinius Collatinus and was renowned, as it chanced, for her beauty and chastity.
36	When a new war was stirred up on the part of the Latins against Rome, the people, demanding that a cancellation of debts be authorized, refused to take up arms.
37	He might try men and put them to death at home and on campaigns, and not merely such as belonged to the populace, but also members of the knights and of the senate itself.
38	When, however, the Latins came to terms and were now in a quiescent state, the lenders proceeded to treat the debtors more harshly and the populace for this reason again rebelled and even came running in a throng into the senate.
39	And all the senators would there have perished at the hands of the inrushing mob, had not some persons at this juncture reported that the Volsci had invaded the country.
40	In the face of such news the populace became calm, not regarding this action, however, in the light of clemency to the senate, for they felt sure that that body would almost immediately be destroyed by the enemy.
41	Inasmuch, however, as they were not relieved of their debts and in general could obtain no decent treatment, they again raised a clamor and grew full of wrath and made an uprising against both the senate and the prætors.
42	He was of the kindred of Poplicola and was beloved by the people.
43	And he, wishing to do the populace some favors, made many addresses to the senate but could not get it to follow his guidance.
44	Consequently he rushed out of the senatorial assembly in a rage, and after making to the populace a long speech against the senate resigned his command.
45	AND THE POPULACE WAS ALL THE MORE PROVOKED TO REVOLT. AS FOR THE MONEYLENDERS, BY INSISTING IN THE CASE OF DEBTS UPON THE VERY
45	LETTER OF THE AGREEMENT AND REFUSING TO MAKE ANY CONCESSION TO THOSE WHO OWED THEM THEY BOTH FAILED TO SECURE THE EXACT AMOUNT
45	AND WERE DISAPPOINTED IN MANY OTHER HOPES. FOR POVERTY AND THE RESULTING DESPERATION IS A HEAVY CURSE, AND IS, IF IT SPREADS
45	AMONG A LARGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE, VERY DIFFICULT TO COMBAT. NOW THE CAUSE OF MOST OF THE TROUBLES THAT BEFELL THE ROMANS LAY IN
45	THE UNYIELDING ATTITUDE ADOPTED AT THIS TIME BY THE MORE POWERFUL TOWARD THEIR INFERIORS. For as the military contingent came
45	to be hard pressed by dint of campaigns and was baffled out and out in frequent hopes frequently entertained, and the debtors
45	were repeatedly abused and maltreated by the moneylenders, the people became inflamed to such a pitch of fury that many of the
45	destitute abandoned the city, withdrew from the camp, AND LIKE ENEMIES GATHERED THEIR SUBSISTENCE FROM THE COUNTRY. WHEN THIS
45	SITUATION HAD BEEN BROUGHT ABOUT, SINCE NUMBERS CAME FLOCKING TO THE SIDE OF THE REVOLUTIONISTS, THE SENATORS, DREADING THAT
45	THE LATTER MIGHT BECOME MORE ESTRANGED AND THE NEIGHBORING TRIBES JOIN THEIR REBELLION FOR PURPOSES OF ATTACK, MADE
45	PROPOSITIONS TO THEM IN WHICH THEY PROMISED EVERYTHING THAT THE SENATE WAS EMPOWERED TO DO FOR THEM. BUT WHEN THEY DISPLAYED
45	THE UTMOST AUDACITY AND WOULD ACCEPT NO OFFER, ONE OF THE ENVOYS, AGRIPPA MENENIUS, BEGGED THEM TO HEARKEN TO A FABLE. HAVING
45	OBTAINED THEIR CONSENT HE SPOKE AS FOLLOWS. ONCE ALL THE MEMBERS OF THE BODY BEGAN A CONTENTION AGAINST THE BELLY. AND THE
45	EYES SAID "WE GIVE THE HANDS THE POWER TO WORK AND THE FEET THE POWER TO GO." AND THE TONGUE AND THE LIPS "THROUGH US THE
45	COUNSELS OF THE HEART ARE MADE KNOWN." AND THEN THE EARS "THROUGH US THE WORDS OF OTHERS ARE DESPATCHED TO THE MIND." AND THE
45	HANDS "WE ARE THE WORKERS AND LAY UP STORES OF WEALTH." AND FINALLY THE FEET "WE TIRE OURSELVES OUT CARRYING THE WHOLE BODY IN
45	JOURNEYS AND WHILE WORKING AND WHILE STANDING." AND ALL IN A CHORUS "WHILE WE LABOR SO, THOU ALONE, FREE FROM CONTRIBUTION AND
45	LABOR, LIKE A MISTRESS ART SERVED BY US ALL AND THE FRUIT OF ALL OUR LABORS THOU THYSELF ALONE DOST ENJOY." THE BELLY HERSELF
45	ADMITTED THAT THIS WAS SO, AND SAID SHE "IF YOU LIKE, LEAVE ME UNSUPPLIED AND MAKE ME NO PRESENTS." THIS PROPOSITION SUITED,
45	AND THE MEMBERS VOTED NEVER MORE TO SUPPLY THE BELLY BY THEIR COMMON EFFORT. WHEN NO FOOD WAS PRESENTED TO HER, THE HANDS WERE
45	NOT NIMBLE TO WORK, BEING RELAXED ON ACCOUNT OF THE FAILURE OF THE BELLY, NOR WERE THE FEET POSSESSED OF STRENGTH, NOR DID ANY
45	OTHER OF THE LIMBS SHOW ITS NORMAL ACTIVITY UNINJURED, BUT ALL WERE INEFFICIENT, SLOW, OR COMPLETELY MOTIONLESS. AND THEN THEY
45	COMPREHENDED THAT THE PRESENTS MADE TO THE BELLY HAD BEEN SUPPLIED NOT MORE TO HER THAN TO THEMSELVES AND THAT EACH ONE OF
45	THEM INCIDENTALLY ENJOYS THE BENEFIT CONFERRED UPON HER. THROUGH THESE WORDS THE POPULACE WAS MADE TO COMPREHEND THAT THE
45	ABUNDANCE OF THE PROSPEROUS TENDS ALSO TO THE ADVANTAGE OF THE POOR, AND THAT EVEN THOUGH THE FORMER BE ADVANTAGED BY THEIR
45	LOANS AND SO INCREASE THEIR ABUNDANCE, THE OUTCOME OF THIS IS NOT HURTFUL TO THE INTERESTS OF THE MANY; SINCE, IF IT WERE NOT
45	FOR THE WEALTHY OWNING PROPERTY, THE POOR WOULD NOT HAVE IN TIMES OF NEED PERSONS TO LEND TO THEM AND WOULD PERISH UNDER THE
45	PRESSURE OF WANT. ACCORDINGLY THEY BECAME MILDER AND REACHED AN AGREEMENT, THE SENATE FOR ITS PART VOTING A REDUCTION IN THEIR
45	DEBTS AND A RELEASE FROM SEIZURE OF PROPERTY. VII, They feared, however, that when their society had been disbanded they might
45	ANOTHER ON ANOTHER, in constant succession. either find the agreements not effectual or might BE HARMED ON ACCOUNT OF THEIR SEPARATION, ONE BEING PUNISHED ON ONE PRETEXT,
46	In order that the titles of the tribuni might be kept distinct they added to the name of the one class the phrase "of the soldiers" and to that of the other class the phrase "of the people.
47	These tribunes of the people, then, or dêmarchoi became responsible for great evils that befell Rome.
48	And if ever they saw fit that anything should not be done, they prevented it, whether the person acting were a private citizen
48	or the vote became null and void. or an official and if the people or the senate were about to do or vote anything and a single tribune opposed it, the action
49	As time went on, they were allowed or allowed themselves to summon the senate, to punish whoever disobeyed them, to practice divination, and to hold court.
50	The tribunes themselves were termed by the multitude "sacrosanct", since they obtained sacred enclosures for the shelter of such as invoked them.
51	Now at first they did not enter the senatehouse, but sitting at the entrance watched proceedings, and in case aught failed to please them, they would show resistance.
52	Patricians the people would not accept having chosen the tribunes to defend them against the patricians, and having advanced
52	them to so great power, they dreaded lest one of them might turn his strength to contrary purposes and use it against them.
53	In addition to them the people chose two ædiles, to be their assistants in the matter of documents.
54	They took charge of everything that was submitted in writing to the plebs, to the populace, and to the senate, and kept it, so that nothing that was done escaped their notice.
55	For this he received various tokens of renown and was given the title of Coriolanus from the people which he had routed.
56	FOR THE TIME HE WAS THUS EXALTED BUT NOT LONG AFTERWARD HE WAS ANXIOUS TO BE MADE PRÆTOR AND FAILED, AND THEREFORE GREW VEXED
56	AT THE POPULACE AND EVINCED DISPLEASURE TOWARD THE TRIBUNES. HENCE THE TRIBUNES WHOSE FUNCTIONS HE WAS ESPECIALLY EAGER TO
56	ABOLISH HEAPED UP ACCUSATIONS AGAINST HIM AND FIXED UPON HIM A CHARGE OF AIMING AT TYRANNY AND EXPELLED HIM FROM ROME. HAVING
56	BEEN EXPELLED HE FORTHWITH BETOOK HIMSELF TO THE VOLSCI. The latter's leaders and those in authority over them were delighted

57	For when the senate voted restoration to Coriolanus and envoys had been despatched to him to this end, he demanded that the land of which the Volsci had been deprived in the previous wars be given back to them.
58	But the people would not relinquish the land.
59	VII, Now the tribunes demanded that some land acquired by the Romans from the enemy be apportioned among the people, and as a result of their action much damage was incurred by the citizens both from the enemy and from one another.
60	And they sent three men to Greece with an eye to the laws and the customs of the people there.
61	These statutes being found pleasing to all were put before the people, and after receiving their ratification were inscribed on ten tablets; for all records that were deemed worthy of safekeeping used to be preserved on tablets.
62	But besides doing this the lawgivers in question, when their year of office had expired, still maintained control of affairs,

63	Lucius Virginius, a man of the people, had a daughter of surpassing beauty whom he intended to bestow in marriage upon Lucius Icilius, a person of similar rank in society.
64	Meanwhile Claudius in terror had hidden himself and Oppius convened the senate; and sending to the populace he enquired what they wanted.
65	Owing to the fear of the ten magistrates for they were now all on the scene that the people would employ the two as leaders against them they were not sent, whereupon the populace grew still more angry.
66	As a consequence the senators were inspired with no slight fear and against the will of the magistrates they sent Valerius and Horatius to the people.
67	The patricians as well as the senate were displeased at the consuls, whom they regarded as favorable to the popular cause, and
67	so did not vote a triumph to them though each had won a war and did not assign to each a day as had been the custom.
68	The reason for their election was that the consuls were unable, on account of the number of the people, to supervise them all;
68	the duties now assigned to the censors had until that time been performed by the consuls as a part of their prerogatives.
69	They had the right to let the public revenues, to supervise roads and public buildings, to make complete records of each man's
69	wealth, and to note and investigate the lives of the citizens, enrolling those deserving of praise in the tribes, in the

71	This arrangement held for a certain time, but later it was determined that a man once enrolled in the senate should be a
71	senator for life and that his name should not be erased, unless one had been disgraced by being tried for the commission of a
71	crime or was convicted of leading an evil life the names of such persons were erased and others inscribed in their stead.
72	One particular man, whom they styled principa of the senate he would be called prokritos by the Greeks was preferred before

73	And he would have gained control of the city, had not Minucius Augurinus, a patrician, appointed to have charge of the grain distribution and censured for the lack of grain, reported the proceeding to the senate.
74	The senate on receiving the information nominated at once and at that very meeting Lucius Quinctius Cincinnatus, though past his prime he was eighty years old, to be dictator.
75	The Romans deeming that something supernatural was certainly signified by this event sent to Delphi to consult the oracle about the matter.
76	But the Pythian god did not specify to which of the divinities nor in what way they should offer these, and the Etruscan appeared to have the knowledge but would explain nothing.
77	NOW WHILE RUFUS WAS MILITARY TRIBUNE, ONCE WHEN HE WAS IN THE FORUM HIS WIFE HAD A VISIT FROM HER SISTER. AT THE ARRIVAL OF
77	THE HUSBAND THE LICTOR, ACCORDING TO SOME ANCIENT CUSTOM, KNOCKED AT THE DOOR. THE CLATTER STARTLED THE WOMAN, WHO WAS NOT
77	FAMILIAR WITH THIS PROCEDURE THEREUPON BOTH HER SISTER AND THE OTHERS PRESENT BURST OUT LAUGHING AND SHE WAS MADE FUN OF AS A
77	SIMPLETON. SHE TOOK THE MATTER AS A SERIOUS AFFRONT AND ROUSED HER HUSBAND TO CANVASS FOR OFFICE. Stolo, accordingly, incited
77	by his wife, confided his intentions to Lucius Sextius, one of his peers, and both forced their way into the tribuneship; they
77	repeatedly obstructed the patrician elections. thus overturned the good order of the State to such an extent that for four years the people had no rulers, since these men

79	Still the uncertainty remained unresolved, for the oracle was obscure.
80	But Marcus Curtius, a patrician, young in years, of a remarkably beautiful appearance, powerful physique, and courageous spirit, conspicuous also for intelligence, comprehended the meaning of the oracle.
81	What should any one deem superior to Man to be cast into the earthfissure, that therewith we might contract it? THERE IS NO
81	MORTAL CREATURE EITHER BETTER OR STRONGER THAN MAN. FOR, IF ONE MAY SPEAK SOMEWHAT BOLDLY, MAN IS NAUGHT ELSE THAN A GOD WITH

82	I myself willingly bestow myself upon you, that you may send me this very day as herald and envoy to the cthonian gods, to be your representative and helper forever.
83	Thereafter, as the armies began to grow insubordinate and a civil war threatened to break out, the insurgents were brought to
83	terms by the enactment of laws that no one's name should be erased from the lists against his will, that any person who had
83	served as tribune of the soldiers should not be centurion, that both of the consuls might belong to and be appointed from the
83	people, and that the same man should not hold two offices at the same time nor hold the same office twice within ten years.
84	In order to insure the articles of the agreement being ratified also by the senate, they retained six hundred of the knights to serve as hostages.
85	So he came forward and said that their acts ought not to be ratified by the senate and the people, FOR THEY THEMSELVES HAD NOT

91	LATTER MANAGED AND ARRANGED EVERYTHING FOR HIM, SPARING HIS OLD AGE NOT A WHIT, YET HE DID NOT LET IT BE SEEN THAT HE WAS

92	He at once impressed those in their prime into service alongside of his own soldiers so as to make sure that they should not

93	A certain Aristarchus, who was accounted one of the noblest of the Tarentini and was a most persuasive speaker, he made his
93	boon companion to the end that this man should be suspected by the people of having the interests of Pyrrhus at heart.
94	Thereby a certain oracle was fulfilled for the Romans.
95	For an oracle had told them once that these people should occupy the Roman treasurehouse.
96	The oracle, then, resulted this way the men lost their lives.
97	In the course of his journey he seized a strong strategic point in the land of the Lucanians, and he left behind a force in Lucania to hinder the people from giving aid to his opponents.
98	But when the other side raised a much greater shout, actually scaring the followers of Pyrrhus, he no longer wanted to come to close quarters, but retired, as if he found the omens bad.
99	Cineas on coming to the city did not seek an audience with the senate, but lingered about, alleging now one reason, now another.
100	When he had won the attachment of a number, he entered the senatechamber and spoke, saying; "King Pyrrhus offers as his
100	defence the fact that he came not to make war upon you, but to reconcile the Tarentini, and in answer to their entreaties.
101	On learning this Appius the Blind was carried to the senatehouse for by reason of his age and his infirmity he was a stayathome and declared that the modus vivendi with Pyrrhus was not advantageous to the State.
102	The senate delayed no longer, but forthwith unanimously voted to send Cineas that very day across the borders and to wage an implacable war with Pyrrhus, so long as he should abide in Italy.
103	AND PTOLEMY PHILADELPHUS, KING OF EGYPT, WHEN HE LEARNED THAT PYRRHUS HAD FARED POORLY AND THAT THE ROMANS WERE GROWING, SENT
103	GIFTS TO THEM AND MADE A COMPACT. AND THE ROMANS, PLEASED WITH THIS, DESPATCHED AMBASSADORS TO HIM IN TURN. THE LATTER

107	After that they were accustomed to wed their mistresses, to inherit their masters, to be enrolled in the senate, to secure the offices, and to hold the entire authority themselves.
108	The envoys urged the senate to convene with secrecy at night in a private house, so that no report might get abroad, and they obtained their request.
109	The people of Carthage, when apprised of it, sent Hanno, with a powerful support, to aid him in the warfare.
110	For all that the people of Agrigentum did not obtain pardon, but their wealth was plundered and they themselves were all sold into servitude.
111	The people of Rome learning this at once sent out the prætor urbanus and incited Duillius to haste.
112	Duillius after securing a reinforcement of infantry rescued the people of Segesta, and Hamilcar would not venture to come into close conflict with him.
113	Upon his departure Hamilcar took forcible possession of the place called Drepanum it is a convenient roadstead, deposited there the objects of greatest value and transferred to it all the people of Eryx.

115	His followers and the people of Rome thought the same way, and this caused their undoing.
116	VIII, The people of Rome were grieved at the turn of events and more especially because they were looking for the Carthaginians to sail against Rome itself.
117	Hence the people, thinking that the damage was due to their inexperience in naval affairs, voted that they should keep away from the sea in general but with a few ships should guard Italy.
118	Metellus ascertained that spies had come from the enemy, and assembling all the people of the city he began a talk with them, in the midst of which he suddenly ordered them to lay hold of one another.
119	VIII, THE CARTHAGINIANS NOW BEGAN NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE ROMANS ON ACCOUNT OF THE GREAT NUMBER OF THE CAPTIVES AMONG OTHER
119	CAUSES; AND WITH THE ENVOYS THEY ALSO SENT REGULUS HIMSELF, THINKING THAT THROUGH HIM THEIR OBJECT HAD PRACTICALLY BEEN
119	ALREADY GAINED BECAUSE OF THE REPUTATION AND VALOR OF THE MAIN AND THEY BOUND HIM BY OATHS TO RETURN WITHOUT FAIL. AND HE
119	ACTED IN ALL RESPECTS LIKE ONE OF THE CARTHAGINIANS; FOR HE DID NOT EVEN GRANT HIS WIFE LEAVE TO CONFER WITH HIM NOR DID HE

120	But the senate out of consideration for his safety showed a disposition to make peace and to restore the captives.
121	Yet they would not give up; nay, they even executed a man who in the senate opened his mouth about reconciliation with the Carthaginians, and they voted that a dictator should be named.
122	The people of Rome soon learned of the victory and were greatly elated, feeling that their superiority was indisputable.
123	Gallic emissaries came before the senate with the aforementioned representations.
124	THE ROMANS TO DIVERT THE BLAME FOR BREAKING THE COMPACT FROM THEMSELVES SENT TO THE PEOPLE OFFERING TO GIVE CLAUDIUS UP. WHEN
124	HE WAS NOT RECEIVED, THEY DROVE HIM INTO EXILE. THEY WERE ON THE POINT OF LEADING AN EXPEDITION AGAINST THE CARTHAGINIANS

127	Consequently he refused to depart until he had settled the whole business in hand, and he said he would teach the people at home, too, not to be deceived by relying on birds or any other such thing.
128	At length the leaders returned home and were put on trial by the senate for their disobedience on account of their anger
128	Flaminius's behalf, so that it voted them a triumph. towards Flaminius they subjected Furius also to disgrace; but the populace was against the senate and showed emulation in

130	The Romans on ascertaining this assembled in their senatehall, and many speeches were delivered.
131	Lucius Cornelius Lentulus addressed the people and said they must not delay but vote for war against the Carthaginians and
131	separate consuls and armies into two detachments, and send the one to Spain and the other to Libya, in order that at one and
131	nor could he himself receive assistance from there. the same time the land of the enemy might be desolated and his allies injured; thus neither would he be able to assist Spain
132	THE OPINIONS OF THE TWO MEN WERE SUBSTANTIALLY THESE. THE SENATE DECIDED TO MAKE PREPARATIONS, TO BE SURE, FOR CONFLICT, BUT
132	TO DESPATCH ENVOYS TO CARTHAGE AND DENOUNCE HANNIBAL; AND IF THE CARTHAGINIANS REFRAINED FROM APPROVING THE EXPLOITS, THEY
132	WOULD ARBITRATE THE MATTER, OR IF ALL RESPONSIBILITY WERE LAID UPON HIS SHOULDERS, THEY WOULD DEMAND HIS EXTRADITION, AND IF
132	done. HE WERE NOT GIVEN UP, THEY WOULD DECLARE WAR UPON THE NATION. The envoys set out and the Carthaginians considered what must be

134	He thought that the gods once, sitting in assembly, sent for him and bade him march with all speed into Italy and receive from them a guide for the way, and that by this guide he was commanded to follow without turning around.
135	The people of Rome again chose Flaminius and Geminus consuls.
136	The people of Rome when informed of the defeat were grieved and lamented both for themselves and for the lost.
137	The people of Rome believed that Rufus had really conquered, and in view of this unexpected encouragement they commended and honored him.
138	After this experience RUFUS ALTERED HIS ATTITUDE, LED THE REMNANT OF THE ARMY IMMEDIATELY INTO FABIUS'S QUARTERS AND LAID DOWN

144	Finally the crowd made a rush upon them as they were assembled in the senatehouse and would have made away with them all but for the action of some one of the crowd who saw how great a misfortune this would be.
145	Having gained the assent of the Capuan people he ejected each one of them from the senatehouse, asking the populace, as he did so, whom they chose in his place.
146	He held a conference with the people and made many attractive offers, among other things promising to give them the supreme

149	The barbarians cut off his head, scooped out the interior and after gilding it used it for a bowl in their sacred ceremonials.
150	Hence the senate upon the request of Gnæus for leave of absence that he might go home and borrow a dowry for his daughter, who was of age to be married, voted that a dowry be given her from the public funds.
151	The people of Rome chose Fabius and Marcellus consuls.
152	The people of Rome were frightened, but still they voted that one of the consuls should remain at Capua while the other defended them.
153	The people of that city although in extremities were nevertheless desperate, believing that they could not obtain pardon from the Romans, and they therefore held out and sent a letter to Hannibal begging him to assist them.
154	The only ones that he left unmolested were the survivors of the common people, and he spared them only on condition that they receive a Roman governor, maintain no senate, and hold no assembly.
155	IX, The people of Rome sent Gaius Claudius Nero with soldiers into Spain.
156	On learning this the people of Rome condemned Nero and voted to entrust the leadership to somebody else.
157	But, although Scipio did not pursue Hasdrubal, he sent runners through whom he apprised the people of Rome of his approach, and he himself gave attention to his own immediate concerns.
158	His brother Lucius he despatched to Rome to report the progress made, to convey the captives thither, and to investigate how the people of Rome felt toward him.
159	The following year upon announcement of Hasdrubal's approach the people of Rome gathered their forces, summoned their allies, and chose Claudius Nero and Marcus Livius consuls.
160	One of Scipio's legions that was in winter quarters near Sucro became restless.
161	Scipio learning this wrote and sent a letter to apostate legion in which he affected to pardon them for revolting on account
161	of the scarcity of the necessities of life, and did not seem to think it proper to view them with suspicion but conferred

162	SCIPIO AFTER WINNING OVER THE WHOLE TERRITORY SOUTH OF THE PYRENEES, PARTLY BY FORCE, PARTLY BY TREATY, EQUIPPED HIMSELF TO
162	JOURNEY TO LIBYA. THE PEOPLE OF ROME, HOWEVER, THROUGH JEALOUSY OF HIS SUCCESSES AND THROUGH FEAR THAT HE MIGHT BECOME
162	ARROGANT AND PLAY THE TYRANT SENT TWO OF THE PRÆTORS TO RELIEVE HIM AND CALLED HIM HOME. THUS HE WAS DEPOSED FROM HIS
162	COMMAND. BUT SULPICIUS TOGETHER WITH ATTALUS OCCUPIED OREUS BY TREACHERY AND OPUS BY MAIN FORCE. PHILIP WAS UNABLE TO SEND
162	THEM SPEEDY AID AS THE ÆTOLIANS HAD SEIZED THE PASSES IN ADVANCE. BUT AT LAST HE DID ARRIVE ON THE SCENE AND FORCED ATTALUS
162	BACK TO HIS SHIPS. PHILIP, HOWEVER, WISHED TO CONCLUDE A TRUCE WITH THE ROMANS. AND AFTER SOME PRELIMINARY DISCUSSION THE
162	PEACE PROPOSITION WAS WITHDRAWN, BUT HE MOVED THE ÆTOLIANS OUT OF THEIR POSITION OF ALLIANCE WITH THE ROMANS AND MADE THEM
162	his. HIS OWN FRIENDS INSTEAD. Hannibal for a time kept quiet, satisfied if he might only retain such advantages as were already
163	The people would scarcely supply him with the necessities.
164	IX, The people of Rome were regretting that they had not prevented the return voyage of Hannibal, and when they learned that he was consolidating the opposition in Libya, they were again terrified beyond measure.
165	WHEN AN AGREEMENT OF THIS NATURE HAD BEEN REACHED, THE CARTHAGINIANS DESPATCHED AMBASSADORS TO ROME.? SO THEY WENT THEIR WAY,
165	BUT THE SENATE DID NOT RECEIVE THE EMBASSY READILY; INDEED, ITS MEMBERS DISPUTED FOR A LONG TIME, ONE PARTY BEING OPPOSED TO
165	ANOTHER. THE POPULAR ASSEMBLY, HOWEVER, UNANIMOUSLY VOTED FOR PEACE AND ACCEPTED THE AGREEMENT AND SENT TEN MEN THAT IN
165	CONJUNCTION WITH SCIPIO THEY MIGHT SETTLE ALL THE DETAILS. AND THE TREATY WAS ACCEPTED, THE TRIREMES WERE GIVEN UP AND BURNED,
165	AND OF THE ELEPHANTS THE LARGER NUMBER WERE CARRIED OFF TO ROME, AND THE REST WERE PRESENTED TO MASINISSA. THE ROMANS NOW
165	ABANDONED LIBYA, AND THE CARTHAGINIANS ITALY. THE SECOND WAR, THEN, WITH THE CARTHAGINIANS RESULTED IN THIS WAY AT THE END OF
165	SIXTEEN YEARS. BY IT SCIPIO HAD BEEN MADE ILLUSTRIOUS, AND HE WAS GIVEN THE TITLE OF AFRICANUS AFRICA WAS THE NAME OF THAT

165	THEREFORE ATTAINED GREAT PROMINENCE BY THESE DEEDS, BUT HANNIBAL WAS ACCUSED BY HIS OWN PEOPLE OF HAVING REFUSED TO CAPTURE
165	ROME WHEN HE WAS ABLE TO DO SO, AND OF HAVING APPROPRIATED THE PLUNDER IN ITALY. HE WAS NOT, HOWEVER, CONVICTED, BUT WAS

167	Attalus expired of old age in the midst of a speech which he was making to the people there.
168	Thus was the Macedonian war terminated and the people of Rome very readily became reconciled with Philip upon the following terms.
169	Now after the defeat inflicted upon the Romans at Cannæ a law had been passed to the effect that women should not wear gold

171	Letters were sent in every direction with orders that they should be delivered to everybody on the same day; and in these he commanded the people to raze the circuit of their fortifications instanter, threatening the disobedient with death.

172	Antiochus should undertake to cross over into Italy that way, and Aulus Atilius to attend to Nabis. to prevent them and Philip from creating any disturbance; and of the prætors they sent Marcus Bæbius to Apollonia, in case

184	Then Manilius went to Utica and remained quiet, while Scipio took Phameas back to Rome, where he himself received commendation and Phameas was honored to the extent of being allowed to sit with the senate in the senatehouse.
185	The people of Rome when informed of the doings of Andriscus sent an army and Publius Juventius, a prætor.
186	Consequently the people of Rome once more despatched a prætor, Quintus Cæcilius Metellus, with a strong body of troops he proceeded to Macedonia and enjoyed the assistance of the fleet of Attalus.
187	Thus did Scipio take Carthage, and he forwarded to the senate a letter in these terms "Carthage is taken.
188	From this beginning the senate became involved in great dispute and contention until some one said that if for no other reason it must be considered necessary to spare them for the Romans' own sake.

203	The Romans knowing this clearly and suspecting further that the envoys would try to corrupt some persons with money, so as to hinder the expedition, voted in the senate that no one should lend them anything.
204	The proof of this is that Pompey took these same men he enrolled the Valerians again and kept them without the slightest show of revolt.
205	Now Clodius, after being captured by the pirates and released by them in consequence of their fear of Pompey, came to Antioch in Syria, declaring that he would be their ally against the Arabians, with whom the people were then at variance.
206	In his eagerness for supremacy he assailed even the Cretans who had come to terms with him, and not heeding their objection that there was a state of truce he hastened to do them harm before Pompey came up.
207	For Pompey had got them away beforehand by persuading one of the tribunes that it was to him they had submitted and not to Metellus.
208	I will now relate the progress of Pompey's career.
209	Wearied by the continued dangers and noting how great and far reaching was the war raised against them, and believing, too,

212	His motion was carried and immediately all save the senate began to favor Pompey.
213	That body was in favor of enduring anything whatever at the hands of the freebooters rather than to put so great command into Pompey's hands.
214	In fact they came near slaying Gabinius in the very halls of the senate, but he eluded them somehow.
215	When the people learned the intention of the senators they raised an uproar, going to the point of making a rush at them as
215	they sat assembled and if the elders had not gotten out of the way, the populace would without doubt have killed them.

233	Cornelius, angry at this, submitted a proposal that the senators be not allowed to grant office to any one seeking it in a way not prescribed by law, nor to vote away any other prerogative of the people.
234	Thereupon arose a great uproar, since many of the senate and Piso in particular resisted; the crowd broke his staves to pieces and threatened to tear him limb from limb.
235	Seeing the rush they made, Cornelius for the time being before calling for any vote dismissed the assembly later he added to

238	Those who urged them most to this course were Caesar and Marcus Cicero.
239	These men seconded the measure not because they thought it advantageous to the state nor because they wished to do Pompey a favor.
240	Inasmuch, however, as things were certain to turn out that way, Caesar cultivated the good will of the multitude he saw, in

241	Incidentally, too, he was willing to render Pompey more envied and invidious as a result of the honors conferred upon him, so that the people might get their fill of him more quickly.
242	But since the crowd was still discontented he entered their assembly, presumably compelled thereto by the tribunes, where he inveighed against the senate and promised to speak in support of Manilius.
243	Probably spurious "because Caesar cultivated the populace from the beginning, whereas Cicero usually played a double part; sometimes he sided with the people, sometimes with the assembly, and for this reason he was termed 'deserter.
244	They were unable, however, to accomplish anything because the plot was announced beforehand and a bodyguard given to Cotta and Torquatus by the senate.
245	And since even so Piso showed signs of audacity, the senate being afraid he would cause some riot sent him straightway to Spain on the pretext that he was to look after some disorder.
246	Pompey was at first making ready to sail to Crete and to Metellus, and when he learned the decrees that had been passed
246	that he might meet some reverse. pretended to be annoyed as before, and charged the members of the opposite faction with always loading business upon him so
247	But Pompey speedily contracted friendship with Phraates on the same terms and persuaded him to invade in advance the Armenia belonging to Tigranes.
248	As for Pompey's command that he lay down his arms and deliver up the deserters, he had no chance to deliberate; for the large
248	they should be compelled to fight without them, raised an uproar. number of deserters who were in his camp hearing it and fearing they should be delivered up, and the barbarians fearing that
249	Pompey, therefore, having decided that he must needs fight, in the course of his other preparations made an additional enlistment of the Valerians.
250	The latter declared the whole conflict over, and said there was no further need of an expedition and that for this reason also the men sent by the senate for the administration of the districts had arrived.
251	Pompey, paying him but slight attention, forbade every one any longer to obey his commands and pressed on against Mithridates, being in haste to join issue with him as quickly as possible.
252	The king for a time kept fleeing, since he was inferior in numbers he continually devastated the country before him, gave Pompey a long chase, and made him feel the want of provisions.
253	Pompey was not bold enough to assail them in that position, but he moved his camp to another spot where the surrounding

255	Pompey followed on, eager to secure a battle.
256	In the course of these events Pompey sent men to pursue him when, however, he outstripped them by fleeing across the Phasis,

257	While Pompey was thus engaged, Tigranes, the son of Tigranes, taking with him some of the foremost men because the father was

258	Pompey, employing him as a guide, made an expedition into Armenia and against his father.
259	When, on account of the opposition of his son, he could gain no moderate terms, and even as things were Pompey had crossed the
259	of his camp. Araxes and drawn near the Artaxatians, then at last Tigranes surrendered the town to him and came voluntarily into the midst
260	Pompey, however, sent an attendant and made him descend from his horse; for Tigranes was riding up as if to enter the very fortification, mounted on horseback according to the custom of his people.
261	By these words Pompey restored his spirits, and then invited him to dinner.
262	But the son, who sat on the other side of Pompey, did not rise at the approach of his father nor greet him in any other way, and furthermore, though invited to dinner, did not present himself.
263	Wherefore he incurred Pompey's most cordial hatred.
264	And inasmuch as this was where the treasures were, the young man began a dispute about them, and not gaining his point for Pompey had no other source from which to obtain the sums agreed upon he became vexed and planned to escape by flight.
265	Pompey, being informed of this beforehand, kept the youth under surveillance without bonds and sent to those who were guarding the money, bidding them give it all to his father.
266	Then Pompey sent him to the forts.
267	When the keepers obeyed as little as before, asserting that he issued the command not of his own free will, but under compulsion, Pompey was irritated and put Tigranes in chains.
268	Thus the elder secured the treasures, and Pompey passed the winter in the land of Anaitis and near the river Cyraus, after dividing his army into three portions.

272	Arthoces, their king, fearing that Pompey would direct his steps against him, too, sent envoys to him on a pretence of peace, but prepared to attack the invader at a time when, feeling secure, he should be therefore off his guard.
273	Pompey learning of this betimes was in good season in making an incursion into the territory of Arthoces, ere the latter had made ready sufficiently or had occupied the pass on the frontier, which was well nigh impregnable.
274	Pompey made himself master of the thoroughfares, left a garrison in charge of them, and advancing from that point subjugated all the territory within the river boundary.
275	Pompey, seeing this, pursued after, overtook and conquered him.
276	Under these conditions Arthoces again sent a herald to Pompey for peace, and forwarded gifts.
277	Thus Pompey waited for a time until in the course of the summer the Pelorus became fordable in places, and then the Romans crossed over; their passage was especially easy as they met no one to hinder them.
278	Pompey, learning directly that the Phasis was not distant, decided to descend along its course to Colchis and thence to march to the Bosphorus against Mithridates.
279	There perceiving that his route on land led through many unknown and hostile tribes, and that the sea journey was rather

287	This was in the consulship Of Lucius Caesar and Gaius Figulus.
288	And when Tigranes invoked the assistance of Pompey, who was in Syria, he sent ambassadors to the Roman commander, making many accusations and throwing out numerous hints against the Romans, so that Pompey was both ashamed and alarmed.
289	Pompey passed the winter in Aspis, winning over the sections that were still resisting, and took Symphorion, a fort which Stratonice betrayed to him.
290	Caesar received praise, but because he had also conducted both the Roman and the Megalesian games on the most expensive scale and had further arranged contests of gladiators in the most magnificent manner.

293	Their successors, too, did nothing in the following year, for the reason that the tribunes hindered them in regard to the list of the senate, in fear lest they themselves should be dropped from that assembly.
294	In the ensuing year, with Figulus and Lucius Caesar in office, notable events were few, but worthy of remembrance in view of the contradictions in human affairs.
295	For the man who had slain Lucretius at the instance of Sulla and another who had murdered many of the persons proscribed by him were tried for the slaughter and punished, Julius Caesar being most instrumental in bringing this about.
296	For, when Marcus Cicero was consul with Gaius Antonius, and Mithridates no longer inflicted any injury upon the Romans but had

297	Mithridates himself did not give way under his disasters, but trusting more in his will than in his power, especially while Pompey was lingering in Syria, planned to reach the Ister through Scythia, and from that point to invade Italy.

300	Pharnaces embalmed his body and sent it to Pompey as a proof of what had been done, and surrendered himself and his dominions.
301	Garrisons which at that date were still holding a few fortifications outside of Bosporus, did not immediately come to terms,

302	Upon him and his neighbors Pompey made a descent, overcame them without effort, and handed them over to a garrison.
303	Their rulers were two brothers, Hyrcanus and Aristobulus, who were themselves quarreling, as it chanced, and stirring up the cities concerning the priesthood for so they called their kingdom of their God, whoever he is.
304	Pompey immediately brought to his side without a battle Hyrcanus, who had no force worthy of note, and by confining Aristobulus in a certain spot compelled him to come to terms.
305	And when he would surrender neither money nor garrison, Pompey threw him into prison.
306	the country has been called Judaea, and the people themselves Jews.

311	The performance for which credit particularly attaches to Pompey himself, which is forever worthy of admiration, I will now proceed to set forth.

319	Other unlucky omens, too, developed.
320	For the tribunes united with Antonius, the consul, who was much like themselves in character, and some one of them supported
320	who had been convicted with him, the right to be members of the senate and to hold office. for office the children of those exiled by Sulla, while a second was for granting to Publius Paetus and to Cornelius Sulla,
321	For Saturninus had been killed some thirtysix years earlier, and the steps taken against him by the consuls of the period had
321	been at the direction of the senate as a result of the present action the senate was likely to lose authority over its votes.
322	The tribunes were eager to overthrow completely the power and the reputation of the senate and were preparing for themselves in advance authority to do whatever they pleased.
323	For the calling to account of acts that had received the approval of the senate and had been committed so many years before
323	tended to give immunity to those who were undertaking anything similar, and curtailed the punishments they could inflict.

326	Caesar himself was judge with Lucius Caesar; for the charge against Rabirius was not a simple one, but the socalled perduellio

327	He had been seeking the consulship even then, and contriving every conceivable way to get appointed, when the senate decreed,
327	chiefly at the instance of Cicero, that a banishment of ten years should be added by law to the penalties imposed for bribery.
328	Cicero learned of the plot beforehand, informed the senate of it, and delivered a long accusation against him.
329	Those who coöperated with him most were In Rome, the consul and Publius Lentulus, who, after his consulship, had been
329	expelled from the senate he was now acting as praetor, in order to gain senatorial rank again; at Faesulae, where the men of

332	As a consequence Lentulus was forced by the senate to resign the praetorship, and was kept under guard along with the others arrested while the remnant of the society was being sought for.
333	These measures pleased the populace equally especially so, when, during a speech of Cicero's on the subject, the statue of

337	The priestly elections, on motion of Labienus supported by Caesar, were again referred by the people to popular vote, contrary to the law of Sulla, but in renewal of the law of Domitius.
338	Caesar at the death of Metellus Pius was eager for his priesthood, although young and not having served as praetor.
339	Toward Caesar, accordingly, for these reasons, the masses were well disposed, but their anger was directed against Cicero for the death of the citizens, and they displayed their enmity in many ways.
340	Sacrifices of oxen were also voted, and the people changed their raiment to signify their deliverance from all dangers.
341	Since even under these circumstances disquietude prevailed in the city and among the allies through ignorance of the persons

342	This complaint, though technically brought against him, was really directed against the senate.
343	For among the populace its members were subject to denunciations of the utmost virulence voiced by Metellus Nepos, to the effect that they had no right to condemn any citizen to death without the consent of the people.
344	The senate had granted immunity to all those who administered affairs during that period and had further proclaimed that if
344	that Nepos was afraid and aroused no further tumult. any one should dare to call any one of them to account again, he should be in the category of a personal and public enemy; so
345	This was not the senate's only victory.

347	Then even Nepos was afraid and retired immediately from their midst subsequently, after publishing some piece of writing against the senate, he set out to join Pompey, although he had no right to be absent from the city a single night.
348	After this occurrence Caesar, who was now praetor, likewise showed no further revolutionary tendencies.
349	He effected the removal of the name of Catulus from the temple of Jupiter Capitolinus he was calling him to account for theft

351	He did not, in fact, act thus for Pompey's sake, but in order that he might ingratiate himself with the populace.

371	Hence, on beholding there a likeness of Alexander dedicated in the temple of Hercules he had given a groan, lamenting that he had performed no great work as yet.
372	But Caesar, neglecting the quadrupeds, took the men by surprise and conquered them.
373	Later, Caesar sent for boats from Gades, crossed over to the island with his whole army and overcame the dwellers there without a blow, as they were in poor condition from lack of food.
374	Thence he sailed along to Brigantium, a city of Gallaecia, alarmed the people who had never before seen a vessel by the breakers which his approach to land caused, and subjugated them.
375	Besides the omens previously recited, on which, he at all times greatly prided himself, was the fact that a horse of his had
375	been born with clefts in the hoofs of its front feet, and bore him proudly, whereas it would not endure any other rider.
376	Here he courted Pompey and Crassus and the rest so skillfully that though they were still at enmity with each other, and their
376	unanimously appointed by them all. political clubs were likewise, and though each opposed everything that he learned the other wished, he won them over and was
377	These reasons led Caesar at that time to insinuate himself into their good graces, and subsequently he reconciled them with each other.
378	Pompey and Crassus, the moment they entered into his plan, themselves made peace each with the other as if of their own accord, and took Caesar into partnership respecting their designs.
379	Pompey, on his side, was not so strong as he had hoped to be, and seeing that Crassus was in power and that Caesar's influence
379	in present advantages, he should win back his old authority through them. was growing feared that he should be utterly overthrown by them; but he had the additional hope that if he made them sharers
380	Crassus thought that he should properly surpass them all by reason of his family as well as his wealth; and since he was far
380	in order that neither of them should have the upper hand. inferior to Pompey and thought that Caesar would rise to great heights, he desired to set them in opposition one to the other,
381	For without supporting in all respects either the policy of the populace or that of the senate he did everything to advance his own supremacy.
382	These portents appeared in advance, an image, as it were, of what should befall the people both on land and on water.

384	The following year Caesar wished to court the favor of the entire multitude, that he might make them his own to an even greater degree.
385	They had a great deal of surplus money, he asserted, as a result of the booty which Pompey had captured, as well as from the
385	incurred, to expend it upon those very persons. new tributes and taxes just established, and they ought, inasmuch as it had been provided by the dangers that citizens had
386	He himself was satisfied with the conception and proposal of the matter; at least he said so, but clearly he was doing a favor to Pompey and Crassus and the rest.
387	So far as the motion went, then, he escaped censure, so that no one, indeed, ventured to open his mouth in opposition for he
387	had read it aloud beforehand in the senate, and calling upon each one of the senators by name had enquired his opinion, for

388	And this very fact troubled them most, that Caesar had compiled such a document that not one could raise a criticism and yet they were all cast down.
389	At this Caesar was on the point of dragging Cato out of the very senatehouse and casting him into prison.
390	The latter gave himself up quite readily to be led away and not a few of the rest followed him; one of them, Marcus Petreius,
390	Cato in his cell rather than here with you. being rebuked by Caesar because he was taking his departure before the senate was yet dismissed, replied "I prefer to be with
391	Abashed at this speech Caesar let Cato go and adjourned the senate, saying only this much in passing "I have made you judges
391	are not willing to pass a decree, that body itself shall decide. and lords of the law so that if anything should not suit you, it need not be brought into the public assembly; but since you
392	Thereafter he communicated to the senate nothing further under this head but brought directly before the people whatever he desired.
393	When the latter made no answer save that he would endure no innovations in his own office, Caesar proceeded to supplicate him and persuaded the multitude to join him in his request, saying "You shall have the law if only he wishes it.
394	Caesar did not address any further enquiries to persons in office, fearing that some one of them might also oppose him; but he

396	Seeing this, Caesar asked him if he would willingly lend assistance against those who took the opposite side, and advised the multitude to ask his aid similarly for this end.
397	When this was done Pompey was elated because both the consul and the multitude had petitioned his help, although he was holding no position of command.
398	These utterances of Pompey Crassus, too, approved.
399	Consequently even if some of the rest were not pleased, most became very eager for the ratification of the law when these men
399	was not yet manifest joined in the approbation of his measure. whose reputations were in general excellent and who were, according to common opinion, inimical to Caesar their reconciliation
400	Finally, when no excuse for delay was any longer left him, he proclaimed a sacred period for all the remaining days of the year alike, during which people could not, in accordance with the laws, come together for a meeting.
401	Caesar paid slight attention to him and announced an appointed day on which they should pass the law.
402	When the multitude by night had already occupied the Forum, Bibulus appeared with the force at his disposal and made his way to the temple of the Dioscuri from which Caesar was delivering his harangue.
403	But when he reached an elevated place and attempted to dispute with Caesar, he was thrust down the steps, his staves were broken to pieces, and the tribunes as well as the others received blows and wounds.
404	Bibulus was for the moment satisfied to save his life, but on the following day tried in the senate to annul the act; however, he effected nothing, for all, subservient to the will of the multitude, remained quiet.
405	Instead he remained in his house, notifying Caesar through his assistants on the introduction of every new measure that it was a sacred period and by the laws he could rightfully take no action during it.
406	By this means Caesar attached to his cause the people, and he won the knights, as well, by allowing them a third part of the taxes which they had hired.
407	All the collections were made through them and though they had often asked the senate to grant them some satisfactory schedule, they had not gained it, because Cato and the others worked against them.
408	When, then, he had conciliated this class also without any protest, he first ratified all the acts of Pompey and in this he
408	met no opposition from Lucullus or any one else, and next he put through many other measures while no one opposed him.
409	As for the rest, Caesar himself proposed, advised and arranged everything in the city once for all as if he were its sole ruler.
410	Hence some facetious persons hid the name of Bibulus in silence altogether and named Caesar twice, and in writing would mention Gaius Caesar and Julius Caesar as being the consuls.
411	Others, believing him a necessary and useful factor in affairs proposed whatever he wished and had it ratified, not only before the populace but in the senate itself.
412	For whereas the multitude granted him the government of Illyricum and of Gaul this side of the Alps with three legions for five years, the senate entrusted him in addition with Gaul beyond the mountains and another legion.
413	Even so, in fear that Pompey in his absence during which Aulus Gabinius was to be consul might lead some revolt, he attached
413	in spite of having betrothed her to another man, and he himself married Piso's daughter. to his cause both Pompey and the other consul, Lucius Piso, by the bond of kinship upon the former he bestowed his daughter,
414	But Cicero and Lucullus, little pleased at this, undertook to kill both Caesar and Pompey through the medium of one Lucius Vettius; they failed of their attempt, however, and all but perished themselves as well.
415	As it was, inasmuch as in his defence he accused the man who had revealed the project to Pompey, he was suspected of not
415	with a view to calumniating the opposite party. speaking the truth on other points either, but created the impression that the matter had been somehow purposely contrived
416	In consequence of this Cicero became an object of suspicion on the part of Caesar and Pompey, and he strengthened their conjecture in his defence of Antonius.
417	That was the way he finally came off; but at the time Cicero in the character of his advocate, because Antonius was his
417	in addition. colleague, made a most bitter assault upon Caesar as responsible for the suit against the man, and heaped some abuse upon him
418	Caesar was naturally indignant at it, but, although consul, refused to be the author of any insolent speech or act against him.
419	Caesar possessed in reality a rather decent nature, and was not easily moved to anger.
420	In the first place, in order that he might be lawfully excluded from the patricians, he transferred him with Pompey's coöperation again to the plebian rank, and then immediately had him appointed tribune.
421	He soon decided that it was not easy to overthrow a man who, on account of his skill in speaking, had very great influence in
421	in regard. politics, and so proceeded to conciliate not only the populace, but also the knights and the senate with whom Cicero most held
422	Clodius therefore hoped that for these reasons, if he should prepare the minds of the senate and the knights and the populace in advance, he could quickly make way with him.
423	Accordingly, many persons who wished to obstruct either the proposal of laws or official appointments that came before the
423	people could ratify nothing during the period. popular assembly were in the habit of announcing that they would use the divination from the sky for that day, so that the
424	Clodius was afraid that if he indicted Cicero some person by such means might interpose a postponement or delay the trial, and
424	anything, observe the signs from heaven. so introduced measure that no one of the officials should, on the days when it was necessary for the people to vote on
425	Thus was the latter, who thought himself extremely wise, deceived on that occasion by Clodius, if we ought to say Clodius and not Caesar and his party.
426	It brought within its scope, indeed, all the senate, because they had charged the consuls with the protection of the city, by
426	that time suffered the death penalty. which act it was permitted the latter to take such steps, and subsequently had voted to condemn Lentulus and the rest who at
427	For this reason he took vigorous retaliatory measures, and discarding senatorial dress went about in the garb of the knights,
427	paying court meanwhile, as he went back and forth, day and night alike to all who had any influence, not only of his friends
427	but also of his opponents, and especially to Pompey and Caesar, inasmuch as they did not show their enmity toward him.
428	Caesar advised him to yield, for fear he might perish if he remained where he was and in order to have it believed the more
428	retire from Clodius's path not with reproach and as if under examination, but in command and with honor. readily that he was doing this through good will, he promised that the other should employ him as helper, so that he might
429	Pompey, however, turned him aside from this course, calling the act outright desertion, and uttering insinuations against
429	Caesar to the effect that through enmity he was not giving sound advice; for his own counsel, as expressed, was for Cicero to
429	remain and come to the aid of the senate and himself with outspokenness, and to defend himself immediately against Clodius the

430	After these speeches from them, modeled in such a way not because the views of the two were opposed, but for the purpose of deceiving the man without arousing his suspicion, Cicero attached himself to Pompey.
431	Also, since Clodius had been a relative of Pompey's and a partner of his campaigns for a long period, it seemed likely that he would do nothing that failed to accord with his wishes.
432	As for Gabinius, Cicero expected that he could count on him absolutely as an adherent, being a good friend of his, and equally on Piso because of his regard for right and his kinship with Caesar.
433	On the basis of these calculations, then, he hoped to win for he was confident beyond reason even as he had been terrified

434	For, in addition to the encouraging circumstances already mentioned, the knights in convention sent to the consuls and senate on the Capitol  envoys in his behalf from their own number, and the senators Quintus Hortensius and Gaius Curio.
435	Clodius would not allow Ninnius to take any action in his behalf, and Gabinius would not grant the knights access to the

436	Gabinius, too, on being asked the same question, not only praised Clodius but indulged in invectives against the knights and the senate.
437	Caesar, however whom since he had taken the field Clodius could make arbiter of the proposition only by assembling the throng
437	punishment proposed for it. outside the walls, condemned the lawlessness of the action taken in regard to Lentulus, but still did not approve the
438	This was Caesar's statement; Crassus showed some favor to Cicero through his son but himself took the side of the multitude.
439	Pompey kept promising the orator assistance, but by making various excuses at different times and arranging purposely many journeys out of town failed to defend him.
440	Cicero seeing this was frightened and again undertook to resort to arms, among other things he did was to abuse Pompey openly with insults but was prevented by Cato and Hortensius, for fear a civil war might result.
441	For of words, as of drugs, there are many varieties and diverse potencies, so that it will not be surprising if you should be able to steep in some mixture of philosophy even me, the shining light of senate, assembly, and lawcourts.
442	The proof is that you nearly always persuaded both the senate and the people in cases where you gave them any advice and helped private citizens very greatly in cases where you acted as their advocate.
443	You advised and performed all that was proper for the citizens, not as individual but as consul, not meddling officiously in a private capacity but obeying the decree of the senate, not as a party measure but for the best ends.
444	He was recalled by Pompey himself, who was most responsible for his expulsion.
445	He outrageously insulted Pompey and Grabinius who had been incensed at the proceeding, inflicted blows and wounds upon their followers, broke to pieces the consul's rods, and dedicated his property.
446	Pompey, enraged by this and particularly because the authority which he himself had restored to the tribunes Clodius had used
446	against him, was willing to recall Cicero, and immediately began through the agency of Ninnius to negotiate for his return.
447	The latter watched for Clodius to be absent and then introduced in the senate the motion in Cicero's behalf.
448	When another one of the tribunes opposed him, he not only went into the matter at some length, intimating that he should communicate it also to the people, but he furthermore opposed Clodius once for all at every point.
449	While this went on in the city, Caesar found no hostility in Gaul everything was absolutely quiet.
450	When Caesar severed the bridge and made other preparations to hinder them from crossing, they sent to him to ask a right of way and promised in addition to do no harm to Roman territory.
451	Then the Sequani and Aedui sent to Caesar to ask assistance, and begged him not to let them perish.
452	Caesar was afraid the Helvetians might turn also against Tolosa and chose to drive them back with the help of the other tribes
452	rather than to fight them after they had effected a reconciliation, which, it was clear, would otherwise be the issue.
453	Caesar's cavalry had galloped far ahead of the infantry and was harassing, incidentally, their rear guards, when they faced about with their horse and conquered it.
454	Caesar saw this, and fearing their impetus and numbers hurried with his infantry to some higher ground but sent forward his horsemen to engage the enemy till he should have marshaled his forces in a suitable place.
455	The barbarians routed them a second time and were making a spirited rush up the hill when Caesar with forces drawn up dashed
455	down upon them suddenly from his commanding position and without difficulty repulsed them, while they were scattered.
456	For Caesar after assigning the fugitives to the care of his cavalry himself with his heavyarmed force turned his attention to the others.
457	So went the first war that Caesar fought; but he did not remain quiet after this beginning.
458	And because they happened to be asking what Caesar was yearning for, they easily persuaded him to assist them.
459	Now Ariovistus was the ruler of those Celts his dominion had been ratified by action of the Romans and he had been registered among their friends and allies by Caesar himself, in his consulship.
460	Ariovistus, instead of obeying, replied "If Caesar wishes to tell me anything, let him come himself to me.
461	The barbarian, enraged at the injunctions, made a long and outrageous reply, so that Caesar no longer bandied words with him
461	but straightway, before any one was aware of his intentions, seized on Vesontio, the city of the Sequani, in advance.
462	And the talk was that they were undertaking a war which was none of their business and had not been decreed, merely on account
462	of Caesar's personal ambition; and they threatened, also, to leave him in the lurch if he should not change his course.
463	For besides many other considerations that might naturally arise, reflect that we who are so many and of such rank members of
463	the senate and knights have come here accompanied by a great mass of soldiers and with money in abundance not to be idle or
463	bound by treaty, repelling any who undertake to do them wrong, and increasing our own possessions. careless, but for the purpose of managing rightly the affairs of our subjects, preserving in safety the property of those
464	For if some god had actually become our sponsor that, even if we should fail to do this, no one would plot against us and we
464	those who are willing to do nothing that is requisite would have some show of excuse. should forever enjoy in safety all that we have won, it would still be disgraceful to say that we ought to keep quiet; yet
465	If, however, any one thinks that the fact of no investigation having been made about this war before the senate and of no vote
465	having been passed in presence of the assembly is a reason why we need be less eager, let him reflect that of all the wars
465	others equally on the spur of the moment. which have ever fallen to our lot some, to be sure, have come about as a result of preparation and previous announcement, but
466	Else for what reason did the people despatch you to this point, for what reason did they send me immediately after my
466	consulship? Why did they, on the one hand, elect me to hold command for five years at one time, as had never been done before,
466	and on the other hand equip me with four legions, unless they believed that we should certainly be required to fight, besides?
466	worse bane to them than an enemy. Surely it was not that we might be supported in idleness or traveling about to allied cities and subject territory prove a
467	Do not think this a small matter and of little moment in that it was I, Caesar, whom he failed to obey, or because he called me Caesar.
468	It was not I that summoned him, but the Roman, the proconsul, the rods, the dignity, the legions it was not I that was summoned by him, but all of these.
469	Do not be surprised that whereas once upon a time I myself did some little business in his behalf both in the senate and before the people I now speak in this way.
470	The tenth legion will be enough for me.
471	At the end of this speech of Caesar's not only did no one raise an objection, even if some thought altogether the opposite,
471	but they all approved his words, especially those who were suspected by him of spreading the talk they had heard mentioned.
472	He had made an exception of the tenth legion because for some reason he always felt kindly toward it.
473	When they had been thus united, Caesar, for fear that by delay they might again become indifferent, no longer remained stationary, but immediately set out and pressed forward against Ariovistus.
474	They did not come to terms, however, since Caesar wished to impose all commands and Ariovistus refused to obey at all.
475	To some extent also Caesar's skill in planning was found to counterbalance the fiery spirit of the Celts and their disorderly, headlong charge.
476	Then, although Caesar kept his army drawn up outside until afternoon, he would not proceed to battle, but when his foe toward evening retired he suddenly came after them and all but captured their palisade.

479	Caesar learned this from the Remi and was on his guard against them subsequently he encamped at the river Axona, collected his soldiers all together and exercised them.
480	Caesar perceived what was going on, but through ignorance of the country did not dare to pursue them immediately.
481	Later he brought into allegiance some of the peoples without fighting and some by war.
482	Opposite Caesar himself they soon turned to flight, but got the better of the major part of his army, capturing the camp without striking a blow.
483	When Caesar became aware of this, he had advanced a little way in pursuit of those he had routed, he turned back and came upon them engaged in pillage within the fortification, where he ensnared and slaughtered them.
484	Caesar assaulted it but was for many days repulsed, until he turned to the making of engines.
485	But Caesar was carefully managing everything every moment, and when they fell on the outposts from every side they were beaten back.
486	Pompey meanwhile had brought about a vote for the recall of Cicero.
487	Spinther the consul was zealous for Cicero partly as a favor to Pompey and partly to damage Clodius, by reason of a private

490	Nepos now, inspired with fear by his colleague and by Pompey and by the other prominent men, changed his attitude, and as the
490	senate decreed, on motion of Spinther, that Cicero should be restored, and the populace on the motion of both consuls voted
490	Pompey, among others, spoke in favor of the enactment, so that that party proved much the stronger. it, Clodius, to be sure, spoke against it to them, but he had Milo as an opponent so that he could commit no violence, and
491	Cicero accordingly came home from exile and expressed his gratitude to both senate and people, the consuls affording him an opportunity, in their respective assemblies.
492	He laid aside his hatred of Pompey for his banishment, became reconciled with him, and immediately repaid his kindness.
493	It was then that Cicero persuaded them to elect Pompey as commissioner of the grain supply and to give him consequently the office of proconsul for five years both within Italy and without.
494	Caesar and Crassus really disliked Cicero, but paid some attention to him when they perceived that he would return in any case, Caesar even while absent displaying some goodwill toward him; they received, however, no thanks for their pains.
495	Cicero, accordingly, took root anew and got back his property and likewise the foundation of his home, although the latter had

497	While this was going on, the people of Alexandria, who for a while did not know that he had departed for Italy or supposed he was dead, placed Berenice his daughter on the throne in his place.
498	The affair, however, became so noised abroad that even the senate was mightily displeased, being urged on to action chiefly by
498	and second, that numerous Romans also on this occasion had taken bribes. Marcus Favonius, who assigned two causes for his indignation, first, that many envoys sent by allies had perished by violence,

500	While mortals were being influenced by money to behave themselves so, Heaven at the very beginning of the next year by
500	striking with a thunderbolt the statue of Jupiter erected on the Alban hill, delayed the return of Ptolemy some little time.
501	This was the way the oracle was given, and it was made public by Cato for it was forbidden to announce to the populace any of the Sibylline statements unless the senate voted it.
502	Yet as soon as the sense of the verses, as usually happens, began to be talked about, he was afraid that it might be

504	The senators then, fearing that Pompey would by this means obtain still greater power, opposed it, using the matter of the grain as an excuse.
505	Ptolemy, when he heard of it, refused the favor of restoration, went to Ephesus, and passed his time in the temple of the goddess.
506	He immediately instituted proceedings against Milo for procuring gladiators what he was doing himself and was likely to be brought to trial for he brought as a charge against his rival.
507	He did this not really in the expectation of convicting Milo, for the latter had many strong champions, among them Cicero and Pompey, but in order that under this pretext he might carry on a campaign against Milo and harass his helpers.
508	He had instructed his clique that whenever he should ask them in the assemblies "Who was it that did or said soandso?" they
508	should all cry out "Pompey!" Then on several occasions he would suddenly ask about everything that could be taken amiss in
508	not speaking of him particularly. Pompey, either in physical peculiarities or any other respect, taking up various small topics, one at a time, as if he were

511	Caesar, also, although not present, was aiding Clodius at this time, and according to some sent him in letters the accusations brought against Cato.
512	So they kept up the conflict, and Pompey, too, encountered some trouble in the distribution of the grain.
513	The fact, however, that Caesar's influence had grown and the populace admired his achievements so much as to despatch ten men

516	This was what caused his displeasure; and as he could not effect anything through the consuls and saw that Caesar had passed beyond the need of keeping faith with him, he regarded the situation as grave.
517	On the basis of some such calculations Pompey began to arm himself against Caesar.
518	The senate, however, was violently enraged, and once while they were wrangling left the room.
519	After doing this the senators entered the senatehouse immediately, intending to vent their wrath upon those who were responsible.
520	But Clodius had meantime jumped to the side of Pompey and espoused his cause again in the hope that if he should help him in securing the prize now at stake, he would make him entirely his friend.
521	As great indignation at this act was shown by the senators, he abandoned the people in the midst of his speech and hastened to the senate, where he came near meeting his end.
522	For the senate confronted him and prevented his going in, while at that moment he was surrounded by the knights and would have
522	bringing fire and threatening to burn his oppressors along with the senatehouse, if they should do him any harm. been torn limb from limb, had he not raised an outcry, calling upon the people for aid; whereupon many ran to the scene
523	But Pompey, not alarmed at all by this, on one occasion rushed into the senatorial assembly, thwarting them as they were just about to vote, and prevented the measure from being carried.
524	So Pompey came out openly as his rival, and Crassus on being interrogated gave the same implication himself, not admitting the
524	was advantageous to the republic. fact, to be sure, but not denying it, either instead, he took, as usual, a middle course and said that he would do whatever
525	In view of this situation Marcellinus and many others were terrified, as they observed their equipment and opposing array, and would no longer frequent the senatehouse.
526	However, the senators did not change their attire nor attend the festivals nor celebrate the feast of Jupiter on the Capitol
526	nor go out to Albanum for the Feriae Latinae, held there for the second time by reason of something not rightly done.
527	And after this Crassus and Pompey were appointed consuls by the interrex, as no one else of the earlier canvassers opposed them.
528	Lucius Domitius, who contested the office up to the very last day of the year, started out from home for the assembly of the
528	farther. people just after dark, but when the boy that carried the torch in front of him was stabbed, he was frightened and went no
529	Hence, as no one else contested their election, and furthermore because of the action of Publius Crassus, who was a son of Marcus and then lieutenant under Caesar, in bringing soldiers to Rome for this very purpose, they were easily chosen.
530	The nomination of the praetors was made in peace, for Cato did not see fit to offer any violence in the matter of the curule aediles, however, assassinations took place, so that Pompey was implicated in much bloodshed.
531	The other officials, too, those elected by the people, they appointed to please themselves for they controlled the elections, and they made friends with the other aediles and most of the tribunes.
532	They themselves made no mention of these matters before either the senate or the populace, but gravely pretended that they wanted nothing further.
533	Many, and especially the friends of Caesar, took offence at this, because those men after obtaining provinces to govern were
533	measure. likely to keep Caesar from holding his position for a much longer time; and therefore some prepared to speak against the
534	And the adherents of Caesar anticipated in this way, kept quiet, and the greater part of the rest, in bondage to fear and satisfied if even so they should save their lives, remained still.
535	For in the meetings of the people where a measure was also under discussion, the right to speak was given to all the private
535	citizens before those that held the offices, to the end, as it seemed, that none of them captivated beforehand by the opinion
535	of a superior should dissimulate the thoughts that he had in mind, but should say what he thought with entire frankness.
536	Trebonius, by shutting all the doors of the senatehouse, caused this man to have spent the night and most of the day there in vain.
537	When Favonius and Ninnius got in somehow unobserved and Cato and Ateius climbed upon the shoulders of some of those standing
537	them both out, wounded the rest who were with them and actually killed a few. around and being lifted up by them declared an omen directing the meeting to break up, the attendants of the tribunes drove
538	After the law was in this way ratified and the people were already departing from the assembly Ateius took Gallus covered with
538	him to them, and by making all the comments that were natural, stirred them mightily. blood he had been struck in being forced out of the gathering, led him into the presence of those still on the spot, exhibited
539	As they had a considerable bodyguard they intimidated the men, immediately called a meeting and passed the additional measures relating to Caesar.
540	These were the same days in which Pompey dedicated the theatre wherein we take pride even at the present time.
541	For some of them, contrary to Pompey's wish, were pitied by the people when they were wounded and ceased fighting and walked about with their trunks raised toward heaven.
542	These are some of the things I have heard; I have heard also that this theatre was not erected by Pompey, but by one Demetrius, a freedman of his, with the money he had gained while making campaigns with the general.
543	No doubt in this Pompey afforded the populace no little delight, but in making with Crassus the levies, according to their votes, he displeased them exceedingly.
544	So the latter group both on his account and because a certain lawsuit, nominally against their lieutenants but really against
544	but, together with the malcontents in the senate, changed their clothing as if for a calamity. them and with reference to their acts had been instituted by some of the tribunes, dared indeed to commit no act of violence,
545	Now when the tribunes endeavored to abolish the levies and rescind the vote for the proposed campaigns, Pompey, for his part, showed no anger.
546	They announced many unusual portents, however, that applied to him, as if they could avoid including the public in their curse
546	wonders, and again when he was setting out they called down many terrible curses upon him. at one time as he was offering on the Capitol the customary prayers for his campaign they spread a report of omens and
547	As for Caesar, he, in the consulship of Marcellinus and Philippus, had made an expedition against the Veneti, who live near the ocean.
548	Caesar, instead of giving these back, sent out different bodies of troops in various directions, some to waste the possessions
548	of those who had joined the revolt and thus to prevent the two bands from aiding each other, and others to guard the
548	against the Veneti. possessions of those that were under treaty for fear they too might cause some disturbance he himself meanwhile went straight
549	Consequently Caesar was in despair until Decimus Brutus came to him with swift ships from the Mediterranean.
550	Of these Caesar slew the most prominent and sold the rest.
551	Caesar attempted by cutting down the forests to make his way into the very mountains, but renounced his plan on account of their size and the nearness of winter, and retired.
552	He did this by sending about evening, as a deserter, one of his allies who spoke their language, and persuaded them that Caesar had met with reverses.
553	The people are themselves Gauls, and dwell next to Celtica, and their territory extends straight along the Pyrenees to the ocean.
554	Finding Caesar there they became afraid and sent to him to make a truce, asking for land or at least the permission to take some.
555	Their elders, condemning their action, came to Caesar even contrary to their advice and asked him to pardon them, laying the responsibility upon a few.
556	This has always, even till now, been considered the boundary, from which they came to the difference in names, since very anciently both the peoples dwelling on each side of the river were called Celts.
557	Caesar, then, first of Romans crossed the Rhine at this time, and later in the consulship of Pompey and Crassus he traversed the channel of Britain.
558	To this land then, Caesar, since he had won over the Morini and the rest of Gaul was quiet, desired to cross.
559	Not many of the barbarians fell, for they had chariot drivers, and being mounted easily escaped the Romans whose cavalry had
559	not yet arrived; but alarmed at the reports about them from the mainland and because they had dared to cross at all and had
559	peace. managed to set foot upon the land, they sent to Caesar some of the Morini who were friends of theirs, to see about terms of
560	But as the Romans meanwhile began to encounter difficulties by reason of a storm which damaged their fleet that was present
560	and also the one on the way, they changed their minds and though not attacking the invaders openly for their camp was strongly
560	destroyed them all, save a few, to whose rescue Caesar came with speed. guarded, they received some who had been sent out to bring in provisions on the assumption that the country was friendly, and
561	And Caesar properly did not intend to make peace with them, but since the winter was approaching and he was not equipped with
561	a sufficient force to continue fighting at that season, moreover because his supplies had failed and the Gauls in absence had
561	only a few. begun an uprising, he somewhat unwillingly concluded a truce with them, demanding this time still more hostages, but obtaining
562	Hence they voted to celebrate a thanksgiving for twenty days but while that was taking place there was an uprising in Spain, which was consequently assigned to Pompey's care.
563	Pompey and Gabinius effected this.
564	So much power did official authority and abundance have as against the decrees of the people and the senate that when Pompey sent orders to Gabinius, then governor of Syria, the latter immediately put his army in motion.
565	Gabinius was later brought to trial for this, but on account of Pompey's influence and the money at his command was not convicted.
566	It was also a surprise to Pompey, because previously he had, through his friends, rescued Gabinius even at a distance, but now while in the suburbs of the city and, as you might say, in the courtroom itself, he had accomplished nothing.
567	Gabinius had injured Syria in many ways, even to the point of inflicting more damage upon the people than had the pirates, who were then in their prime.
568	However, when Ptolemy came with Pompey's letter and promised that he would furnish large sums, both to him and the army, Gabinius abandoned the Parthian project and hastened to Egypt.
569	This he did although the law forbade governors to enter any one's territory outside their own borders or to begin wars on their own responsibility, and although the people and the Sibyl had declared that the man should not be restored.
570	He himself then reached Palestine, arrested Aristobulus, who had caused some trouble at Rome and escaped, sent him to Pompey, imposed tribute upon the Jews and thereafter invaded Egypt.
571	The people learned it directly, for the Syrians cried out loudly against Gabinius, especially since in his absence they were
571	owing numerous sums. terribly abused by the pirates; and again the tax collectors, being unable to levy taxes on account of the marauders, were
572	Pompey and Crassus were still consuls, the former acted as his own interests dictated, the latter was for pleasing his colleague and also soon received money sent him by Gabinius.
573	Domitius was hostile to Pompey on account of the latter's canvass and because he had been appointed consul contrary to his wish.
574	Claudius, although a relative of Pompey's, still wished to play the game of politics and indulge the people, and furthermore he expected to get bribes from Gabinius, if he should cause him any uneasiness.
575	They decided, therefore, that the verse of the Sibyl should be read, in spite of Pompey's opposition.
576	So insistent were they that although nothing about punishment was found in the Sibylline oracles, still the senate passed a preliminary resolution that the governors and populace might accord him very bitter and harsh treatment.
577	Practically the entire populace surged into the courthouse and often wished to tear him to pieces, particularly because Pompey was not present and Cicero accused him with fearful earnestness.
578	For he himself, appreciating the gravity of the charges on which he was tried, expended vast sums of money, and the companions
578	and, most important of all, that no punishment for his deeds were recorded in her verses. of Pompey and Caesar very willingly aided him, declaring that a different time and different king were meant by the Sybil,

580	Hence they condemned him, in spite of Pompey's proximity and Cicero's advocacy of his cause.

584	At this same time the wife of Pompey died, after giving birth to a baby girl.
585	And whether by the arrangement of Caesar's friends and his or because there were some who wished on general principles to do
585	Martius. them a favor, they caught up the body, as soon as she had received proper eulogies in the Forum, and buried it in the Campus
586	The opposition of Domitius and his declaration among others that it was impious for any one to be buried in the sacred spot without some decree proved of no avail.

590	But Caesar by a powerful assault forced them to leave the palisade and later on by siege drove them from the fort, and others repulsed a party of theirs that attacked the harbor.
591	Under these circumstances Caesar departed entirely from the island and left no body of troops behind in it.
592	As a matter of fact they despised the garrison, thinking they would not prove competent to defend themselves and expecting that Caesar would not speedily head an expedition against their tribe.
593	The Romans were persuaded by this disclosure, especially as he had received many favors from Caesar and seemed in this to be repaying him in kindness.
594	After this event some other of the neighboring tribes revolted, among them the Nervii, though Quintus Cicero, a brother of Marcus Cicero and lieutenant of Caesar, was wintering in their territory.
595	In this way Caesar learned of what was taking place he had not yet gone to Italy but was still on the way, and, turning back, took with him the soldiers in the winter establishments through which he passed, and pressed rapidly on.
596	Thus Cicero, on learning of the advent of Caesar, took courage and held out more stubbornly.
597	Learning from them that Caesar was at last drawing near they set out against him, thinking to attack him while off his guard.
598	The Treveri, indeed, when Caesar sent for the principal men of each tribe and punished them, through fear that they, too,
598	Indutiomarus. might be called upon to pay the penalty assumed again a hostile attitude, lending an attentive ear to the persuasions of
599	This was what took place in Gaul, and Caesar wintered there so as to be able to keep strict control of affairs.

602	Therefore even in war the people lead about whole droves so that they can use some horses at one place and others at another, can ride up suddenly from a distance and also retire to a distance speedily.
603	Owls and wolves were seen, prowling dogs did damage, some sacred statues exuded sweat and others were destroyed by lightning.
604	The offices, partly through rivalry but chiefly by reason of birds and omens, were with difficulty filled at last in the seventh month.
605	The omens were of the following nature.
606	There is a small shrine and in it a golden eagle, which is found in all the legions that are on the register, and it never moves from the winterquarters except the whole army goes forth on some errand.
607	He had pledged himself to peace with the Romans in the time of Pompey, but now chose the side of the barbarians.
608	Accompanied by the people of that city, whom he hoped to win over easily, because they were Greeks, he could cross without difficulty to Ctesiphon.
609	And the Parthians, as some say, poured gold into his mouth in mockery; for though a man of great wealth he was so eager for money as to pity those who could not support an enrolled legion from their own means, regarding them as poor men.
610	They had hopes of subjugating also what remained, since the Romans were not at hand with a force fit to cope with them, and the people were fretting under Roman rule but ready to turn to the invaders, who were neighbors and acquaintances.
611	In that same period Caesar by battle again gained control of Gallic affairs, which were in an unsettled state.
612	Labienus then gathered his soldiers and addressed them in words of such a nature as were likely to alarm his own men and
612	gave the signal to pack up the baggage. encourage the others they must, he said, before the Celtae repelled them, withdraw to Caesar and safety; and he immediately
613	Not a few of them escaped even so, of whom Caesar made no account, except of Ambiorix this man by hurrying now one way and now another and doing much injury caused Caesar trouble in seeking and pursuing him.
614	Inspired with a fear of Caesar by this encounter they hurriedly withdrew homeward he inflicted no punishment upon any one of
614	them because of the winter and the political disputes in Rome, but after dismissing the soldiers to their winterquarters, went
614	place in the city. himself to Italy on the plea of caring for Hither Gaul, but really in order that he might be located close to what was taking
615	Caesar, on ascertaining this, returned and found that they had invaded the Bituriges.
616	After effecting this Caesar conducted a campaign against their territory.
617	He himself with the strongest portion remained behind, cut down the wood, made rafts, and on them crossed the stream while the
617	barbarians still had their attention fixed on those going along in front and calculated that Caesar was among them.
618	The people fled in a body to Gergovia, carrying there all their most valued possessions, and Caesar had a great deal of toil to no purpose in besieging them.
619	For Caesar, not having any sure position to choose, was encamped in the plain and never knew beforehand what was going on but the barbarians, higher up, could look down upon his camp and kept making opportune charges.
620	All these considerations led Caesar to raise the siege.
621	He, having been unable by any other course to persuade them to adopt a hostile attitude, managed to get the appointment of conveying some men to Caesar to be the latter's allies.
622	Caesar, as soon as he ascertained this, sent to them the Aedui whom he had and was thought to have slain, so that they might be seen by all to be alive, and followed on with his cavalry.
623	The Romans were later, by reason of Caesar's absence, defeated close to Gergovia and then entirely withdrew from that country;
623	Romans might exact vengeance from them, and consequently rebelled entirely. wherefore those who had caused the uprising and were always desirous of a change in politics feared that if they delayed the
624	Members of their tribe who were campaigning with Caesar, when they learned of this, asked him to allow them to return home, promising that they would arrange everything.
625	Caesar, therefore, attempted to march against them at once, but not being able, on account of the river Liger he turned his attention to the Lingones.
626	Before this happened Vercingetorix, filled with contempt for Caesar because of his reverses, had marched against the Allobroges.
627	Having discovered this device Caesar did not give ground, but shut up in Alesia such of the foe as fled, and besieged them.
628	But Caesar to begin with had not sufficient himself to feed others.
629	Now Vercingetorix might have escaped, for he had not been captured and was unwounded, but he hoped because he had once been on friendly terms with Caesar, that he would obtain pardon from him.
630	So he came to him without any announcement by herald, but appeared before him suddenly, as Caesar was seated on a platform,
630	imposing figure. and threw some that were present into alarm; he was first of all very tall, and in a suit of armor he made an extremely
631	But Caesar reproached him in this very matter on which he most relied for ultimate safety, and by setting before him how he had repaid friendliness with the opposite treatment proved his offence to have been the more abominable.
632	Then Caesar by garrisons and legal penalties and levies of money and assignment of tribute humbled some and tamed others.
633	Caesar in the interest of the Gauls and to see about the term allowed him for leadership had to leave Gaul and return to Rome.
634	Affairs in the city at this time were in turmoil, Crassus was dead, and Pompey had again come to power, after being three times consul and having managed to get the government of Spain granted to him for five years more.
635	The latter had no longer any bond of alliance with Caesar, especially now that the child, who alone had kept them on friendly terms, had passed away.
636	The returning general therefore was afraid that stripped of his soldiers he might fall into the power of Pompey and of his other enemies, and therefore did not dismiss them.
637	And not even then would they have been chosen, had not Quintus Pompeius Rufus, though the grandson of Sulla and serving as

638	When no one would heed them, they declared that Pompey, at all events, must be chosen dictator.
639	By this pretext they secured a very long delay for he was out of town, and of those on the spot there was no one who would
639	choose Pompey, on account of their fear of him. venture to vote for the demand for in remembrance of Sulla's cruelty they all hated that policy, nor yet venture to refuse to
640	These likewise on account of the turmoil from assassinations did not appoint any successors, though they had laid aside their senatorial garb and in the dress of knights convened the senate as if on the occasion of some great calamity.
641	It seems to me that that decree passed the previous year, near the close, with regard to Serapis and Isis, was a portent equal to any the senate decided to tear down their temples, which some private individuals had built.
642	For they did not reverence these gods any long time and even when it became the fashion to render public devotion to them, they settled them outside the pomerium.
643	The people in the city heard of this about evening and were thrown into a terrible uproar for to factional disturbances there

644	The body of Clodius they picked up and carried into the senatehouse, arranged it in due fashion, and then after heaping a pyre of benches burned both the corpse and the convention hall.

646	When this other act, however, occurred, he hoped that the wrath of the senate would pass over to the outrage of the opposing party.
647	They had assembled late in the afternoon on the Palatine for this very purpose, and had voted that an interrex be chosen by
647	detriment. show of hands and that he and the tribunes and Pompey, moreover, care for the guarding of the city, that it suffer no
648	As a consequence of this, conflicts and killings in plenty began again, so that the senate ratified the aforementioned measures, summoned Pompey, allowed him to make fresh levies, and changed their garments.
649	Not long after his arrival they assembled under guard near his theatre outside the pomerium and resolved that the bones of Clodius should be taken up, and assigned the rebuilding of the senatehouse to Faustus, son of Sulla.
650	The city was in a fever of excitement about the magistrates who should rule it, some talking to the effect that Pompey ought to be chosen dictator and others that Caesar should be elected consul.
651	Fearing both of the men the rest of the senate and Bibulus, who was first to be asked and to declare his opinion, anticipated
651	he might not have Caesar as his colleague. the onset of the masses by giving the consulship to Pompey to prevent his being named dictator, and to him alone in order that
652	For since he favored the masses less than Caesar, they hoped to detach him from them altogether and to make him their own.
653	Elated by the novelty and unexpectedness of the honor, he no longer formed any plan to gratify the populace but was careful to do everything that pleased the senate.
654	Also he felt afraid that, as the field was vacant, Caesar might be given him as colleague through the enthusiasm of the powerful classes and the populace alike.
655	Pompey himself then chose as assistant Quintus Scipio, who was his fatherinlaw and had incurred a charge of bribery.
656	He had given his daughter in marriage to Pompey, and now received in turn from him the consulship and immunity from accusation.
657	Very many had been examined in the complaint above mentioned, especially because the courts, by Pompey's laws, were more carefully constituted.
658	Scipio was indicted, and by two persons at that, but was not tried, on account of Pompey and Milo was not charged with this
658	as he was not able to use any violence. crime for the murder formed a greater complaint against him, but being brought to trial on the latter charge he was convicted,
659	Pompey kept the city in general well under guard and himself with armed soldiers entered the court.

661	In this way Milo was convicted; and so were Rufus and Plancus, as soon as they had finished their term of office, together with numerous others on account of the burning of the senatehouse.
662	Plancus was not even benefited by Pompey, who was so earnest in his behalf that he sent to the court a volume containing both a eulogy of the prisoner and a supplication for him.
663	But he got no opportunity to cast his vote; for Plancus rejected him, feeling sure that he would give his voice for
663	condemnation by the laws of Pompey each of the parties to a suit was allowed to set aside five out of the number that were to

664	And when they saw Pompey coöperating with him, they showed the more zeal against him, for fear they might be thought to be absolute slaves of his rather than jurymen.
665	It should be said that on this occasion, too, Cicero accused Plancus no better than he had defended Milo for the appearance of
665	a second collision between them. the courtroom was the same, and Pompey in each case was planning and acting against him, a circumstance that naturally led to
666	After attending to these matters Pompey revived the law about elections which had fallen somewhat into disuse commanding those
666	who seek an office to present themselves without fail before the assembly, so that no one who is absent may be chosen.
667	He was not ashamed at this time to record such measures, although a little later he himself took Spain for five years more and
667	decreed, even in his absence. granted Caesar, whose friends were in a terrible state of irritation, the right to canvass for the consulship as had been
668	Such were the political acts of Pompey.
669	Cato on the whole did not wish any office, but seeing Caesar and Pompey outgrowing the system of government, and surmising

670	measures against him that he proposed was one to the effect that a successor to him should be sent before the appointed time.
671	He was resisted by Sulpicius and some of the tribunes, by the latter out of good will toward Caesar.
672	Pompey was starting from the city with the avowed intention of leading an expedition into Spain, but he did not at this time
672	on the city. even leave the bounds of Italy, and after assigning to his lieutenants the entire business abroad he himself kept close watch
673	Now when he heard how things were going, he pretended that the plan of having Caesar detached from his command did not please
673	him either, but he arranged matters so that when Caesar should have served out the time allowed him, an event not of the

676	So, by buoying him up with many hopes and releasing him from all his debts which on account of his great expenditures were numerous, Caesar attached him to himself.
677	In view of the present importance of the objects for which he was working he did not spare money, since he could collect it

680	Some bills he offered against the senate and its most powerful members, who were especially active in Pompey's behalf, not
680	because he either wished or expected that any one of them would be passed, but in order that, as they did not accept them, so
680	himself might transfer his support on this excuse. no measure might be passed against Caesar for many motions to his detriment were being offered by many persons, and that he
681	On the contrary he already began openly to justify Caesar's actions, since, as he said, he was unable to accomplish anything against him, and brought forward every possible proposition which was sure of not being accepted.
682	The chief of these was that all persons in arms must lay these down and disband their legions, or else they should not strip Caesar of his weapons and expose him to the forces of his rivals.
683	This he said, not because he wished Caesar to do it, but because he well understood that Pompey would not yield obedience to it, and thus a plausible excuse was offered the former for not dismissing his soldiers.
684	Pompey, accordingly, as he could effect nothing in any other way, proceeded without any further disguise to harsh measures and openly said and did everything against Caesar.
685	Caesar had many followers, among them Lucius Paulus, colleague of Marcellus, and Lucius Piso, his fatherinlaw, who was censor.
686	So Piso on account of his relationship belonged to Caesar, while Claudius opposed him, espousing Pompey's cause, yet quite involuntarily he rendered Caesar very efficient aid.
687	He expelled very many both of the knights and the senators, overpowering his colleague, and in this made them all favor Caesar's aspirations.
688	Piso on every account wished to avoid trouble and to maintain friendship with his soninlaw paid court to many people, being

689	Consequently Claudius did not expel him but made public in the senate the opinion that he had of him, so that he, indignant, rent his clothes.
690	Marcellus followed him, and thinking that the senate would pass some severe vote against Curio and, because of him, against Caesar, brought forward propositions about him.
691	Curio at first opposed any decision being rendered regarding him; but on coming to realize that of the majority of the
691	senators then present some really were attached to Caesar's cause and others thoroughly feared him, he allowed them to decide,
691	surrender both my body and soul to treat as you please. saying incidentally only this "I am conscious of doing what is best and most advantageous for my country to you, however, I
692	Marcellus accordingly accused him, thinking that he would certainly be convicted, and then when he was acquitted by the
692	majority the accuser took it greatly to heart rushing out of the assembly he came to Pompey, who was in the suburbs, and on
692	civilians. his own responsibility, without the formality of a vote, gave him charge to keep guard over the city along with two legions of
693	Pompey before this, while he was still on friendly terms with Caesar, had given him one legion composed of those troops which
693	according to the register belonged to him, inasmuch as he was not conducting any war and Caesar had need of soldiers.
694	When they fell out with each other, in his desire to get this back from him and to deprive him of yet another he delivered a
694	speech, stating that Bibulus required soldiers against the Parthians; and in order that no new levies should be raised, for

695	Thereupon he failed to despatch any of those engaged in warfare under his own command, but ordered those whose business it was to demand that legion which he had given to Caesar.

706	In the letter was contained a list of the benefits which Caesar had conferred upon the commonwealth and a defence of the charges which were brought against him.
707	He promised that he would disband his legions and give up his office if Pompey would also do the same for while the latter bore arms, he said, it was not just for him to be compelled to part with his and so be exposed to his enemies.
708	The vote on this proposition was taken not individually for fear that through having respect to others or some element of fear

709	No one voted that Pompey should cease to bear arms for he had his troops in the suburbs, but all, except one Marcus Caelius and Curio, who had carried his letter, decided that Caesar must.
710	Their opinion, however, was recorded and the appropriate action followed namely, all straightway left the senatehouse, and
710	after changing their clothes came in again and proceeded to deliberate about vengeance to be taken on the obstructionists.
711	They, seeing this, at first resisted but later became afraid, especially when Lentulus advised them to get out of the way
711	little heeding that they had been expelled from the senate. before the votes should be cast hence after many remarks and protestations they set out with Curio and with Caelius to Caesar,
712	Afterward the senators went outside the pomerium to Pompey himself, declared that there was a state of disorder, and gave to him both the money and soldiers.
713	They voted that Caesar should surrender his office to his successors and send away his legions by a given day, or else be considered an enemy, because acting contrary to the interests of the country.
714	Pompey, perceiving this, was frightened, especially when he learned all his intentions from Labienus.
715	The latter had abandoned Caesar and come as a deserter, and he announced all the latter's secrets to Pompey.
716	One might feel surprise that after having always been honored by Caesar in the highest degree, to the extent of governing all the legions beyond the Alps whenever their head was in Italy, he should have done this.
717	The reason was that when he had clothed himself with wealth and fame he began to conduct himself more haughtily than his
717	position warranted, and Caesar, seeing that he put himself on the same level with his master, ceased to be so fond of him.
718	Pompey as a result of what was told him about Caesar and because he had not yet prepared a force to cope with him changed his
718	from the war through remembrance of the deeds of Marius and Sulla and wished to escape it in safety. plans for he saw that the dwellers in the city, yes, the members of the sedition themselves, even more than the others, shrank
719	Therefore he sent as envoys to Caesar, Lucius Caesar, a relative of his, and Lucius Roscius, a praetor, both of them
719	volunteering for the service, to see if he could avoid his open attack and then make an agreement with him on some fair terms.
720	The other replied to the same effect as in his letter, previously forwarded, and said also that he wished to converse with Pompey but the people were displeased to hear this, fearing that some measures might be concerted against them.
721	When, however, the envoys uttered many words in praise of Caesar, and finally promised besides that no one should suffer any
721	harm at his hands and that the legions should immediately be disbanded, they were pleased and sent the same envoys to him
721	at the same time. again, and besought both of the opposing leaders with shouts, calling upon them everywhere and always to lay down their arms
722	Pompey was frightened at this, knowing well that he would be far inferior to Caesar if they should both have to depend on the

725	The departing citizens, practically all of whom were the foremost men of the senate and of the knights and of the populace, nominally were setting out for war, but really were undergoing the experiences of captives.
726	Such as removed with their entire household said farewell to the temples and their houses and their paternal threshold with
726	Pompey's intention, had the purpose, in case they should survive, of establishing themselves in Macedonia or Thrace. the feeling that these would straightway become the property of their opponents they themselves, not being ignorant of

728	Most of all they bewailed their own lot, seeing the magistrates and the senate and all the rest who had any power, they were not sure whether a single one of them would be left behind, cast out of their country and away from them.
729	Being the first to await the wrath and the lust of the oncoming foe, they remembered their former sufferings, some by
729	did not look to Caesar for moderate treatment. experience and others by hearing it from the victims, all the outrages that Marius and Sulla had committed, and they therefore
730	Since, then, all of them were in this condition, and no one except those who appeared to be good friends of Caesar made light
730	of the situation, and even they, in consideration of the change of character to which most men are subject according to their
730	circumstances, were not courageous enough to think that the source of their confidence was reliable, it is not easy to
730	conceive how great confusion and how great grief prevailed at the departure of the consuls and those who set out with them.
731	They invoked the gods, showered kisses on the floors, enumerated how many times and from what perils they had survived, and lamented that they were leaving their country, a venture they had never made before.
732	Pompey thus left the city drawing many of the senators after him; some remained behind, either attached to Caesar's cause or maintaining a neutral attitude toward both.
733	Caesar, when he learned this, did not hurry to Rome it, he knew, was offered as a prize to the victors, and he said that he was not marching against that place as hostile to him but against his political opponents in its behalf.
734	And he sent a letter throughout all Italy in which he summoned Pompey to a kind of trial, encouraged all to be of good cheer, bade them remain in their places, and made them many promises.
735	Pompey, inasmuch as these citizens were being besieged and many of the others were falling off to Caesar, had no further hope of Italy but resolved to cross over into Macedonia, Greece, and Asia.
736	He derived much encouragement from the remembrance of what he had achieved there and from the friendship of the people and the princes.
737	Spain was likewise devoted to him, but he could not reach it safely because Caesar had possession of both the Gauls.
738	Meanwhile Pompey proceeded with his preparations to evacuate the country in safety his associates learning this shrank from the journey abroad, because it seemed to them a flight, and attached themselves to Caesar.
739	So these joined the invader's army but Domitius and the other senators after being censured by Caesar for arraying themselves in opposition, were released and came to Pompey.
740	Caesar now was anxious to join issue with him before he sailed away, to fight it out with him in Italy, and to overtake him
740	others, fearing that they might begin some rebellion if they stayed on the spot. while he was still at Brundusium; for since there were not sufficient boats for them, Pompey had sent forward the consuls and
741	Caesar, seeing the difficulty of capturing the place, urged his opponent to accede to some agreement, assuring him that he should obtain both peace and friendship again.
742	When Pompey made no further response than that he would communicate to the consuls what Caesar said, the latter, inasmuch as they had decided to receive no citizen in arms for a conference, assaulted the city.
743	Pompey repelled him for some days until the boats came back.
744	Pompey accordingly deserted in this way his country and the rest of Italy, choosing and carrying out quite the opposite of his
744	former course, when he sailed back to it from Asia; wherefore he obtained the reverse fortune and the reverse reputation.
745	Formerly he broke up his legions at Brundusium, in order not to cause the citizens any solicitude, but now he was leading away through the town to fight against them other forces gathered from Italy.
746	Instead of the brilliance, therefore, which, acquired in those wars, had marked his arrival, he set out with humiliation as
746	infamous for his desertion of her. his portion in return for his fear of Caesar and instead of fame which he had had for exalting his country, he became most
747	The sun, too, suffered a total eclipse, and thunderbolts damaged a sceptre of Jupiter, a shield and a helmet of Mars that were votive offerings on the Capitol, and furthermore the tablets which contained the laws.
748	Many animals brought forth creatures outside of their own species, certain oracles purporting to be those of the Sibyl were made known, and some men becoming inspired practiced numerous divinations.
749	The people were, then, naturally disturbed at the portents, but as both sides thought and hoped that they could lay them all on their opponents, they offered no expiatory sacrifices.
750	Caesar at this time did not even attempt to sail to Macedonia, because he was short of boats and had fears for Italy, dreading that the lieutenants of Pompey from Spain might assail and occupy it.
751	There the senate had been assembled for him outside the pomerium by Antony and Longinus they, who had been expelled from it, now convened that body.
752	Therefore he censured no one and delivered no threat against any person, but made an attack not without imprecations upon
752	harmony to the consuls and to Pompey. those who wished to war against citizens, and at last moved that ambassadors be sent immediately in behalf of peace and
753	They remembered also the behavior of Marius and Sulla, how many kind things they had often told them, and then what treatment
753	they had given them in return for their confidence, and furthermore perceiving Caesar's necessity and seeing that his armed
753	followers were many and were everywhere in the city, they were unable either to trust or to be cheered by his words.
754	The people, far from getting at that time the money which he had promised them, had to give him all the rest that remained in the public coffers for the support of his soldiers, whom they feared.
755	In fact, Caesar's other projects also, as I have often stated, he both brought to vote and carried out in the same fashion, under the name of democracy, the most of them being introduced by Antony, but with the substance of despotism.
756	After taking these steps Caesar occupied Sardinia and Sicily without a battle, as the governors there at that time withdrew.
757	Aristobulus he sent home to Palestine to accomplish something against Pompey.
758	Affairs, at home he now committed to Antony's care and himself set out for Spain which distinctly chose to follow Pompey and caused him some uneasiness lest his rival should induce the Gallic countries to revolt.
759	Meantime Cicero and other senators did not appear in Caesar's sight, but retired to join Pompey, who, they believed, had more justice on his side and would conquer in the war.
760	For the consuls before setting sail and Pompey using the authority of proconsul had ordered them all to accompany him to

761	For this reason most of the senators and the knights, some of them immediately and others later, and all the cities that were not subdued by Caesar's arms, embraced his cause.
762	The Massilians, however, alone of the peoples who dwell in Gaul, refused to coöperate with Caesar, and would not receive him into their city, but made a noteworthy answer to him.
763	On being placed in a state of siege they repulsed Caesar himself and held out for a very long time against Trebonius and Decimus Brutus, who subsequently besieged them.
764	Caesar contended stoutly for some time, thinking to capture them easily, and regarding it as ridiculous that after vanquishing
764	them to the care of others and himself hastened to Spain. Rome without a battle he was not received by the Massilians; but later, when their resistance proved stubborn, he committed
765	When Caesar came up not much later, he crossed the river by another bridge and challenged them to battle; but they did not dare to try conclusions with him for a very considerable number of days, and remained quietly encamped opposite him.
766	After this they took courage, attacked Caesar's foraging parties and harassed the scattered members.
767	Caesar, when this continued to happen, fell into desperate straits none of his allies rendered him assistance, for his

768	The Romans at home, when they ascertained it, renounced all hopes of him, and believing that he would survive but a short time longer fell off to Pompey.
769	But for this nothing would have prevented Caesar's projects from being ruined.
770	As it was, however, the victory by preconcerted arrangement was announced to the Spaniards with so many embellishments that it led some of them to change and follow the fortunes of Caesar.
771	His departure proved no secret, yet he was not immediately pursued, for Caesar did not think it safe in the darkness to follow up with men who were strangers to the place an enemy that was well acquainted with the country.
772	They tried to break through at many points, but were unable to do so anywhere they were wearied from loss of sleep and from

776	Caesar himself proceeded by boat to Tarraco.
777	Thence he advanced across the Pyrenees, but did not set up any trophy on their summits because he understood that not even

778	While this was going on the Massilians, as ships had again been sent them by Pompey, faced danger afresh.
779	They were defeated, to be sure, on this occasion also, but held their ground even though they learned that Caesar was already master of Spain.
780	All attacks they vigorously repulsed and made a truce, pretendedly for the purpose of arranging terms with Caesar, when he should come.
781	With Caesar, however, when he came himself, they made terms he at that time deprived them of their arms, ships and money, and later of everything else except the name of freedom.
782	To counterbalance this misfortune Phocaea, their mother city, was made independent by Pompey.
783	At Placentia some soldiers mutinied and refused to accompany Caesar longer, under the pretext that they were exhausted, but
783	were hoping to obtain anything whatever of him, inasmuch as he stood in such tremendous need of them. really because he did not allow them to plunder the country nor to do all the other things on which their minds were set; they

790	Caesar after doing this and removing all the Capitoline offerings and others hastened to Brundusium toward the close of the year and before entering upon the consulship to which he had been elected.
791	When he had gone, the boys in the city spontaneously divided into two classes, one side calling itself Pompeiians and the
791	other Caesarians, and they fought one another after a fashion without arms, and those conquered who used Caesar's name.
792	While such was the progress of events in Rome and in Spain, Marcus Octavius and Lucius Scribonius Libo by using Pompey's fleet expelled from Dalmatia Publius Cornelius Dolabella, who was there attending to Caesar's interests.
793	Curio had meanwhile reduced Sicily without a battle; for Cato, the governor of it, being no match for him and not wishing idly

801	Under these conditions, with the government divided in twain, Pompey wintered in Thessalonica and did not keep a very careful guard of the coast.
802	He did not think that Caesar had yet arrived in Italy from Spain, and even if he were there he did not suspect that his rival, in winter, at least, would venture to cross the Ionian sea.
803	Caesar was in Brundusium, waiting for spring, but when he ascertained that Pompey was some distance off and that Epirus just
803	opposite was rather heedlessly guarded, he seized the opportunity of the war to attack him while in a state of relaxation.

808	Wishing therefore, to sail himself to Italy, and alone, he embarked on a small boat as some one else, saying that he had been sent by Caesar; and he forced the captain, although there was a wind, to set sail.
809	Then the latter revealed himself, as if by this act he should stop the storm, and said, "Be of good cheer you carry Caesar.
810	Such a disposition and such a hope he had, either accidentally or as the result of some oracle, that he felt a secure trust in safety even contrary to the appearance of things.
811	After this he encamped opposite Pompey, near Apsus.
812	Caesar advanced to meet him as far as the river, thinking that even as he was he would prove a match for the troops then approaching but when he learned that he was actually far inferior in numbers, he halted.
813	Pompey, knowing this, wished to try conclusions with him as soon as possible and for this reason undertook to cross the river.
814	Meanwhile Antony had arrived, and Pompey in fear retired to Dyrrachium.
815	While Bibulus lived, Caesar's lieutenant had not dared even to set out from Brundusium, so close was the guard kept over it.
816	When the soldiers had come safely across, Pompey, as I have said, retired to Dyrrachium, and Caesar followed him, encouraged by the fact that he had survived his previous experiences with the number of followers he now had.
817	Pompey after taking refuge in this Dyrrachium built a camp outside the city and surrounded it with deep ditches and stout palisades.
818	Caesar encamped over against it and made assaults, in the hope of shortly capturing the palisades by the number of his soldiers when, however, he was repulsed, he attempted to wall it off.
819	While he was at that work, Pompey fortified some points by stakes, cut off others by a wall, and fortified still others with a

820	Upon Dyrrachium itself Caesar made an attempt by night, between the marshes and the sea, in the expectation that it would be betrayed by its defenders.
821	After this occurrence Pompey took courage and concerted a plan for a night assault upon the circumvallation; as he was unexpected he captured a portion of it by storm and caused a great slaughter among the men encamped near it.
822	Caesar in view of this event and because the grain had failed him, the entire sea and land in the vicinity being hostile, and
822	abandoned by his other followers. because for this reason some had deserted, feared that he might either be overcome while watching his adversary or be
823	Thither, accordingly, Caesar hastened, thinking that by combining with these officers he could more easily get an abundance of food and continue the prosecution of the war.
824	Pompey did not institute an immediate pursuit, for his antagonist had withdrawn suddenly by night and had hastily crossed the Genusus river however, he was strongly inclined to think that he had subdued him completely.
825	As regards a fleet he was absolute master, for he had five hundred swift ships and could touch at many points at once and the

826	But after this he set out against Caesar and came to Thessaly.
827	In temper they differed from each other to this extent, that Pompey desired to be second to no man and Caesar to be first of
827	all, and the former was anxious to be honored by willing subjects and to preside over and be loved by a people fully
827	and bestowed the honors with his own hand upon himself. consenting, whereas the latter cared not at all if he ruled over an unwilling nation and issued orders to men that hated him,
828	As to forces, Caesar had the largest and the most genuinely Roman portion of the citizenarmy and the most warlike men from the
828	rest of Italy, from Spain, and the whole of Gaul and the islands that he had conquered Pompey had attracted many from the
828	peoples and kings. senatorial and the equestrian order and from the regular enrollment and had gathered a vast number from subject and pacified

830	While Pompey decidedly excelled in numbers, Caesar's followers were equal to them in strength, and so, the advantage being even, they just balanced each other and were equally prepared for danger.
831	When they reflected on this fact and furthermore recalled their former deeds, Pompey, Africa and Sertorius and Mithridates and

832	Caesar and Pompey, therefore, fearing that if they remained quiet any longer their animosity might be dulled or they might
832	even become reconciled, hurriedly commanded the trumpeters to blow the signal and the men to raise the war cry in unison.
833	Pompey surpassed in his body of horse and archers; hence they surrounded troops from a distance, employed sudden assaults, and
833	now to that. after throwing them into confusion retired; then again and still again they would attack them, changing now to this side and

835	before the action. wounded, Pompey, since the larger part of his army was Asiatic and untrained, was defeated, even as had been made clear to him
836	Thunderbolts had fallen into his camp, a fire had appeared in the air over Caesar's ditch and then fell up his own, bees had swarmed upon his military standards, and many of the victims after being led up close the very altar had run away.
837	And so far did the effects of that contest extend to the rest of mankind that on the very day of the battle collisions of
837	armies and the clash of arms occurred in many places in Pergamum a kind of noise of drums and cymbals rose from the temple of
837	Dionysus and spread throughout the city; in Tralles a palm tree grew up in the temple of Victory and the goddess herself
837	turned about toward an image of Caesar located beside her; in Syria two young men as they seemed announced the result of the
837	battle and vanished; and in Patavium, which now belongs to Italy but was then still a part of Gaul, certain birds not only

838	Of Pompey's followers who were not destroyed on the spot some fled whithersoever they could, and others changed their allegiance.
839	Those of them who were solders of the line Caesar enrolled among his own troops, exhibiting no resentment.
840	The rest who had then for the first time fought against him he released, saying "Those have not wronged me who have advanced the interests of Pompey, their friend, and had received no benefit from me.
841	These he praised far more than such as had previously received some kindness from Pompey but in the midst of dangers had left
841	him in the lurch the former he could reasonably expect would be favorably disposed to him also, but as to the latter, no

843	What need is there of listing the rest who sent auxiliaries, to all of whom he granted pardon and merely exacted money from

848	As a result of it Pompey straightway despaired of all his undertakings and no longer made any account of his own valor or of

849	In this way he had not been compelled to yield to disasters and was able with ease to renew the conflict but this time as he had expected to far surpass Caesar he had foreseen nothing.
850	Hence Pompey, also, having considered none of the chances beforehand, was found naked and defenceless, whereas, had anything been foreseen, he might, perhaps, without trouble have quickly recovered all his losses.
851	This was the son of that Ptolemy who, through the agency of Gabinius, had received back the kingdom at his hands, and he had as an acknowledgment of that service sent a fleet to Pompey's assistance.
852	I have heard that Pompey thought also of fleeing to the Parthians, but I cannot credit the report.
853	For that race so hated all the Romans ever since Crassus had led his expedition against them, and Pompey especially, because related to him, that they imprisoned his envoy who came with a request for aid, though he was a senator.
854	And Pompey would have never endured in his misfortune to become a suppliant of a most hostile nation for what he had failed to obtain while enjoying success.
855	Ptolemy made him no answer, for he was still a mere child, but some of the Egyptians and Lucius Septimius, a Roman who had
855	made campaigns with Pompey but was a relative of Gabinius and had been left behind by him to keep guard over Ptolemy, came in
855	Egypt. the guise of friends for all that they impiously plotted against him and by their act brought guilt upon themselves and all
856	Now at this time Septimius and Achillas, the commanderinchief, and others who were with them declared they would readily receive Pompey, to the end, of course, that he might be the more easily deceived and ensnared.
857	After many friendly greetings they begged him to come over to their vessels, saying that by reason of its size and the shallow
857	water a trireme could not closely approach their land and that they were very eager to see Pompey himself more quickly.
858	Such was the end of the famous Pompey the Great, wherein once more the weakness and the strange fortune of the human race are proved.
859	The man whom at that time Roman soldiers were still guarding, soldiers left behind by Gabinius as a favor to Pompey and on

862	The former under a safe conduct came later safely to Rome the latter, Sextus, proceeded to Africa to his brother Gnaeus; these are the names by which they are distinguished, since they both bore the appellation Pompey.
863	Caesar, when he had attended to pressing demands after the battle and had assigned to certain others Greece and the remainder of that region to win over and administer, himself pursued after Pompey.
864	Everything turned out favorably for him for instance, while crossing the Hellespont in a kind of ferryboat, he met Pompey's

865	He did away with the taxgatherers, who abused the people most cruelly, and he converted the product of the taxes into a payment of tribute.
866	Meanwhile, learning that Pompey was sailing to Egypt, he was afraid that his rival by occupying it in advance might again acquire strength, and he set out with, all speed.
867	On discovering that the people of the city were in a tumult over Pompey's death he did not at once venture to disembark, but put out to sea and waited till he saw the head and fingerring of the murdered man, sent him by Ptolemy.
868	Caesar at the sight of Pompey's head wept and lamented bitterly, calling him countryman and soninlaw, and enumerating all the kindnesses they had shown each other.
869	He had from the outset been thoroughly set upon dominion; he had always hated Pompey as his antagonist and adversary; besides
869	all his other measures against him he had brought on this war with no other purpose than to secure his rival's ruin and his

870	Under the belief that now that Pompey was out of the way there was no longer any spot left that was hostile to him, he spent some time in Egypt collecting money and adjudicating the differences between Ptolemy and Cleopatra.
871	Egypt revolted, and Pharnaces had begun, just as soon as he learned that Pompey and Caesar were at variance, to lay claim to
871	his ancestral domain he hoped that they would consume much time in their disputes and use up their own powers upon each other.
872	He was at this time still clinging to the districts mentioned, partly because he had once asserted his claim and partly because he understood that Caesar was far off; and he had occupied many points in advance.
873	Cato had been left behind at Dyrrachium by Pompey to keep an eye upon reinforcements from Italy, in case any one should cross, and to repress the Parthini in case they should cause any disturbance.
874	At first he carried on war with the latter, but after Pompey's defeat he abandoned Epirus and proceeding to Corcyra with those
874	of the same mind as himself he there received the men who escaped from the battle and the rest who had the same interests.
875	Cicero and a few other senators had set out for Rome at once but the majority, together with Labienus and Afranius, since they

879	He did seize Patrae and there received among other accessions Petreius and Pompey's soninlaw Faustus.
880	Subsequently Quintus Fufius Calenus led an expedition against them, whereupon they set sail, and coming to Cyrene there learned of the death of Pompey.
881	Their views were now no longer harmonious Cato, loathing the thought of Caesar's sovereignty, and some others in despair of
881	getting pardon from him, sailed to Africa with the army, added Scipio to their number, and were as active as possible against
881	them Gaius Cassius, went to Caesar forthwith and received assurance of safety. Caesar; the majority scattered, and some of them retired to make their peace as each one best might, while the rest, among

883	Athens although he did a great deal of damage to its territory he was unable to take before the defeat of Pompey.
884	The inhabitants then capitulated voluntarily and Caesar without resentment released them altogether, making only this remark, that in spite of their many offences they were saved by the dead.
885	Wherefore a great slaughter of the people was instituted and the survivors sold.
886	After these achievements Caesar marched upon Patrae and occupied it easily, as he had frightened out Cato and his followers in advance.
887	All that he said or did was of a neutral character, so that whether Caesar or Pompey should prevail he would seem to have fought for the cause of either one.
888	He favored Pompey by receiving those who transferred their allegiance to him and by fighting against Longinus, who declared he
888	was on Caesar's side at the same time he did a kindness to Caesar because he assumed charge of the soldiers when as he would

889	And when the soldiers inscribed the name of Pompey on their shields he erased it so that he might by this act offer to the one
889	man the deeds done by the arms and to the other their reputed ownership, and by laying claim to one thing or the other as done
889	in behalf of the victor and by referring the opposite to necessity or to different persons he might continue safe.
890	He continued in this way until Caesar conquered, when, having incurred the victor's wrath, he was temporarily banished, but was later brought back from exile and honored.
891	The population of Rome while the interests of Caesar and Pompey were in a doubtful and vacillating state all professedly espoused the cause of Caesar, influenced by his troops that were in their midst and by his colleague Servilius.
892	Privately the talk and actions of those who detested Caesar and preferred Pompey's side were the very opposite of their public expressions.
893	Caesar sent no despatch to the government, hesitating to appear to be rejoicing publicly over such a victory, for which reason

894	When at last they gave the story credence, they took down the images of Pompey and of Sulla that stood upon the rostra, but did nothing further at that time.
895	A large number did not wish to do even that, and an equally large number fearing that Pompey might renew the strife regarded
895	this as quite enough for Caesar and expected that it would be a fairly simple matter to placate Pompey on account of it.
896	But when he appeared to be really dead, at last they openly praised the winner and abused the loser and proposed that everything in the world which they could devise be given to Caesar.

901	All the elections except those of the people were put in his hands and for this reason they were delayed till after his arrival and were carried on only toward the close of the year.
902	The governorships in subject territory the citizens themselves of course allotted to the consuls, but they voted that Caesar

903	Caesar had at that time heard not a word of the mere inception of the war against Juba and against the Romans who had fought on his side, and yet they assigned a triumph for him to hold, as if he had been victor.
904	Caesar entered upon the dictatorship at once, though he was outside Italy, and chose Antony, who had not yet been praetor, as
904	that no one was allowed to be master of the horse for more than six months. his master of the horse and the consul proposed his name, although the augurs most strongly opposed him with the declaration
905	They incurred, however, a great deal of laughter for this, deciding that Caesar should be chosen dictator for a year contrary to all ancestral precedent, and then splitting hairs about the master of the horse.
906	Marcus Caelius actually perished because he dared to break the laws laid down by Caesar regarding loans of money, as if their propounder was defeated and ruined, and because he had therefore stirred up to strife Rome and Campania.
907	He had been very prominent in carrying out Caesar's wishes, for which reason moreover he had been appointed praetor; but he

909	Servilius consequently sent for some soldiers who chanced to be going by on the way to Gaul and after convening the senate under their protection he presented a proposition about the matter in hand.
910	After this he would not permit Caelius, even in his capacity as praetor, to do anything, but assigned the duties pertaining to

912	It was to him that Caelius wished to betake himself, in order that with his aid he might do Caesar all possible harm.
913	At last, therefore, he approached the consul and obtained from him leave of absence, saying that he wished to proceed to Caesar.
914	The other, though he suspected his intention, still allowed him to do this, particularly because he was very insistent, invoking Caesar's name and pretending that he was eager to submit his defence.
915	Servilius, learning of this in advance, declared war upon Milo in the senate and gave orders that Caelius who must be prevented from stirring up any confusion should remain in the suburbs.
916	As it proved, Milo had been driven from Campania and had perished in Apulia Caelius therefore went to Bruttium, presumably to

917	On the contrary, many dreadful events took place, as, indeed, omens indicated beforehand.
918	Among other things that happened toward the end of that year bees settled on the Capitol beside the statue of Hercules.
919	At the time sacrifices to Isis chanced to be going on and the soothsayers gave their opinion to the effect that the precincts of that goddess and of Serapis should be razed to the ground, as of yore.
920	The following year a violent earthquake occurred, an owl was seen, thunderbolts descended upon the Capitol and upon the temple

924	And not only were the existing conditions most distressing to the Romans, but they dreaded a far greater number of more terrible acts from Caesar.
925	For when the master of the horse never laid aside his sword even at the festivals, who would not have been suspicious of the dictator himself? At the most of these festivals Antony presided at the orders of Caesar.
926	This, too, naturally resulted in a great disturbance and many weapons were everywhere in evidence, although the senators had

930	one another and on the rest until they learned that Caesar, having settled the affairs of Egypt, had started for Rome.
931	Dolabella in despair of obtaining any pardon from Caesar desired to accomplish some great evil and then perish, with the idea that he would forever have renown for this act.
932	Instead, the greater the number of those who perished, the more did the survivors raise a tumult, thinking that Caesar had got involved in a very great and difficult war.
933	Some of them were expecting to suffer every conceivable ill fate, for there was talk against them all through the city, and some made one charge and others another but Caesar at this juncture also pursued his usual method.
934	For in place of overlooking that favor because he had been wronged, he pardoned him in consideration of the benefit received,
934	and besides bringing him to other honors Caesar not long after appointed him consul, though he had not yet served as praetor.
935	These were the events which were brought about in Rome by Caesar's absence.
936	The reasons why he was so long in coming there and did not arrive immediately after Pompey's death are as follows.
937	As a result, then, of their vexation at this and their further fear that they might be surrendered to Cleopatra, who had great influence with Caesar, they commenced a disturbance.
938	For a time the princess had urged her claim against her brother through others who were in Caesar's presence, but as soon as
938	she discovered his disposition which was very susceptible, so that he indulged in amours with a very great number of women at

947	But he, understanding that this was not the child's command, but Caesar's, so far from giving it any attention was filled with contempt for the sender, believing him afraid.
948	Then he called his soldiers together and by haranguing them at length in favor of Ptolemy and against Caesar and Cleopatra he

949	Caesar, when the news was brought him, summoned his soldiers from Syria, put a ditch around the palace and the other buildings near it, and fortified it with a wall reaching to the sea.
950	Achillas commanded the mainland, with the exception of what Caesar had walled off, and the latter the sea except the harbor.
951	Caesar, indeed, was victorious in a seafight, and when the Egyptians consequently, fearing that he would sail into their

952	While these events were taking place one Ganymedes, a eunuch, abducted Arsinoë, as she was not very well guarded, and led her out to the people.
953	Caesar, therefore, in fear that Pothemos might kidnap Ptolemy, put the former to death and guarded the latter strictly without any further dissimulation.
954	Caesar was anxious to bring the people to a condition of peace, and so he had Ptolemy take his stand on a high place from which they could hear his voice and bade him say to them that he was unharmed and was averse to warfare.
955	Now if he had talked thus to them of his own accord, he could have persuaded them to become reconciled; but as it was, they suspected that it was all prearranged by Caesar, and they would not yield.
956	One day Caesar noticed them behaving carelessly, by reason of their supremacy, and suddenly sailed into the harbor, where he burned a number of boats, and disembarking on Pharos slew the inhabitants of the island.
957	While these fugitives were forcing their way into them at any point and in crowds, Caesar, besides many others, fell into the sea.
958	They also kept a close watch upon the landings for the legions which had been sent from Syria were now near at hand and did the Romans much injury.
959	Caesar could ward off in a way the attack of those who assailed him in the direction of Libya but near the mouth of the Nile

961	Caesar thought that they had in very truth changed front, especially since he heard that they were cowardly and fickle and perceived that at this time they were terrified in the face of their defeats.
962	Caesar through fear of being ambushed did not pursue them but at night he set sail as if he were hurrying to some outlet of
962	this direction. the Nile and kindled an enormous fire on each vessel so that it might be thought that he was going a very long distance in
963	In this way Caesar overcame Egypt.
964	For her husband was still a child and in view of Caesar's favor there was nothing that she could not do.
965	Hence her living with her brother and sharing the sovereignty with him was a mere pretence which she accepted, whereas she actually ruled alone and spent her life in Caesar's company.
966	She would have detained him even longer in Egypt or else would have at once set out with him for Rome, had not Pharnaces drawn Caesar most unwillingly from Afric's shores and hindered him from hurrying to Italy.
967	This man was a son of Mithridates and ruled the Cimmerian Bosporus, as has been stated it was his desire to win back again all

968	While he was thus engaged Caesar himself did not stir, Egypt was not yet settled and he had some hope of overcoming the man through others but he sent Gnaeus Domitius Calvinus, assigning him charge of Asia and.. legions.
969	For on ascertaining that Caesar was on the way and was hurrying into Armenia Pharnaces turned back and met him there near Zela.
970	Now that Ptolemy was dead and Domitius vanquished Caesar had decided that delay in Egypt was neither fitting nor profitable for him, but set out from there and by using great speed reached Armenia.
971	One of the principal pleas that he presented was that he had not coöperated with Pompey, and by this he hoped that he might

972	Caesar suspected this, and the first and second sets of envoys he treated with great kindness in order that he might fall upon

974	Caesar took great pride in the victory, more, indeed, than in any other, in spite of the fact that it had not been very
974	glorious, because on the same day and at one and the same hour he had come to the enemy, had seen him, and had conquered him.
975	He did not dare to take down that of the barbarians because it had been dedicated to the gods of war, but by the erection of his own he overshadowed and to a certain extent demolished the other.
976	The people of Amisus he rewarded with freedom, and to Mithridates the Pergamenian he gave a tetrarchy in Galatia with the name

977	On the one hand he levied all that individuals had promised in advance to Pompey, and on the other he asked for still more from outside sources, bringing some accusation against the places to justify his act.
978	All votive offerings of Heracles at Tyre he removed, because the people had received the wife and child of Pompey when they were fleeing.
979	This he did not out of malice but because his expenditures were on a vast scale and because he was intending to lay out still more upon his legions, his triumph, and everything else that could add to his brilliance.
980	However to a certain extent he did court the favor of the people as individuals.
981	To the majority he allowed the interest they were owing, an act by which he had incurred the enmity of Pompey, and he released
981	them from all rent for one year, up to the sum of five hundred denarii; furthermore he raised the valuations on goods in which
981	considerably lowered the price for the populace on all confiscated property. it was allowable according to law for loans to be paid to their value at the time of payment, and this after having
982	By these acts he gained the attachment of the people; and he won the affection of the members of his party and those who had fought for him also.
983	To the knights in his army and to the centurions and subordinate officers he gave among other rights the important privilege of choosing some of their own number for the senate to fill the places of those who had perished.
984	These nearly killed Sallust, who had been appointed praetor so as to recover his senatorial office, and when escaping them he

985	Caesar as soon as he heard of their approach wished to send his guard against them, but fearing that it too might join the uprising he remained quiet until they reached the suburbs.
986	Next they asked to be released from service and were very clamorous on this point, not because they wished to return to
986	private life, they were far from anxious for this since they had long become accustomed to the gains from warfare but because

987	At these words they were struck with alarm both at his attitude in general and because he had called them Quirites and not
987	soldiers; and humiliated, in fear of suffering some calamity, they changed their stand, and addressed him with many entreaties
987	and offers, promising that they would join his expedition as volunteers and would carry the war through for him by themselves.
988	When they had reached this stage and one of their leaders also, either on his own impulse or as a favor to Caesar, had said a

989	Caesar put side the turbulent spirits among them, not all, but as many as were moderately well acquainted with farming and so could make a living, and the rest he used.
990	Africa had not been friendly to Caesar formerly, but after Curio's death it became entirely hostile.
991	Finally they reached such a condition of readiness and disposition that, as no army opposed them and Caesar delayed in Egypt and the capital, they despatched Pompey to Spain.

1000	Caesar besides exalting Lepidus with these honors chose him subsequently as his colleague in both the positions mentioned.
1001	In Africa, too, Petreius and Labienus who had observed that Caesar had gone out to villages after grain, by means of the
1001	as a result the force was in utter confusion, they killed many of the soldiers at close quarters. Nomads drove his cavalry, that had not yet thoroughly recovered strength from its seavoyage, in upon the infantry; and while
1002	Even as it was, by this deed they alarmed Caesar considerably.
1003	Though he had no benefit from Caesar to start with, and although in general he was not known to him, he undertook to share in the war and to help him to overcome the existing difficulty.
1004	Accordingly he bore no direct aid to Caesar himself, for he heard that the latter was at a distance and thought that his own assistance for he had no large body of troops would prove of small value to him.
1005	This fact made it as evident as one could wish that if Juba had also come up, Caesar would never have withstood the two.
1006	Therefore, while keeping as strict a watch over the camp as he could, Caesar sent to Italy for soldiers and elephants.
1007	The latter's reasons for this step were, first, the persuasion of the Gaetuli, who, they heard, had been greatly honored, and second, the fact that they remembered Marius, who was a relative of Caesar.
1008	For Scipio, fearing lest his own power be spent too soon, would no longer risk a battle with Caesar, but sent for Juba.
1009	At that, Juba appointed others to have charge of the operations against Sittius, and once more started out himself against Caesar.
1010	While this was going on Caesar tried in every way to draw Scipio into close quarters.
1011	Not that some of them would not have chosen his cause by preference, if any announcement similar to Caesar's had been made
1011	liberate the Roman people and the senate. their failure to do so was due to the fact that he promised them nothing in the way of a prize, but merely urged them to
1012	But Caesar was not for getting into close quarters with them if he could help it.
1013	Seeing this his opponents marshaled themselves in turn, but did not join issue with Caesar's troops.
1014	Accordingly Caesar, who bethought himself that because of the nature of the land he could not force them to come into close
1014	his forces, or, if they neglected it, he might capture the place. quarters unless they chose, started toward Thapsus, in order that either they might come to the help of the city and so engage
1015	On his way toward this city Caesar, when he had come within these narrow approaches, proceeded to dig ditches and to erect palisades.
1016	They were still at work, and accomplishing a great deal every day for in order that they might build the wall across more
1016	quickly they had assigned the elephants to that portion along which a ditch had not yet been dug and on that account was
1016	the followers of Scipio, and with slings and arrows from a distance threw the elephants into thorough confusion. somewhat accessible to the enemy, while on the remaining defences all were working, when Caesar suddenly attacked the others,
1017	Caesar, immediately after Juba's flight, captured the palisade and wrought a vast slaughter among all those that met his troops he spared not even those who would change to his side.
1018	Wherefore, no matter how full permission was given him by Caesar, yet in his History the man himself had chiseled his own code of principles deep, as upon a tablet.
1019	Scipio, who had fled from the battle, chancing upon a boat set sail for Spain and Pompey.
1020	Cato, since many had sought refuge with him, was at first preparing to take a hand in affairs and to offer a certain amount of resistance to Caesar.
1021	But the men of Utica were not in the beginning hostile to Caesar, and now, seeing him victorious, would not listen to Cato.
1022	This made the members of the senate and the knights who were present afraid of arrest at their hands, and they took counsel for flight.
1023	Cato himself decide neither to war against Caesar indeed, he lacked the power, nor to give himself up.
1024	This was not through any fear he understood well enough that Caesar would have been very ready to spare him for the sake of
1024	aught at the hands of any man, and regarded pity emanating from Caesar as more hateful than death. that reputation for humaneness but it was because he was passionately in love with freedom, and would not brook defeat in
1025	He called together those of the citizens who were Present, enquired whither each one of them had determined to proceed, sent them forth with supplies for the journey, and bade his son betake himself to Caesar.
1026	When he had done this, after sending to the people of Utica an account of his administration and returning to them the surplus
1026	funds, as well as whatever else of theirs he had, he was filled with a desire to depart previous to Caesar's arrival.
1027	Thus Cato, who had proved himself both the most democratic and the strongest willed of his contemporaries acquired a great

1028	Caesar declared that with him he was angry, because Cato had grudged him the distinction attaching to the preservation of such
1028	volition, and others later, so as to approach him after time should have somewhat blurred his memory. a man, but released his son and most of the rest, as was his custom for some came over to him immediately of their own
1029	Caesar put them to death without a trial, on the ground that they were captives for a second time.
1030	And in the case of Lucius Caesar, though the man was related to him and came a voluntary suppliant, nevertheless, since he had
1030	fought against him straight through, he at first bade him stand trial so that the conqueror might seem to have some legal

1031	Caesar after these events at once and before crossing into Italy disencumbered himself of the more elderly among his soldiers for fear they might revolt again.
1032	From that point he sent the discarded troops in the company of Graius Didius into Spain against Pompey, and himself returned
1032	senate. to Rome, priding himself chiefly upon the brilliance of his achievements but also to some extent upon the decrees of the

1035	Seeing also that on this account excessive honors had been accorded him, through flattery but not through goodwill, he began
1035	to encourage the Romans and to inspire them with hope by the following speech delivered in the senate "Let none of you,
1035	Conscript Fathers, expect that I shall make any harsh proclamation or perform any cruel act merely because I have conquered
1035	and am able to say whatever I may please without being called to account, and to do with authority whatever I may choose.
1036	However, I was never otherwise minded in times past, as my works themselves, indeed, doubtless prove and now I shall feel far

1037	utmost zeal they had taken part with various enemies against me, but I took pity on all those that had withstood me but once,
1037	saving many alive of those that fought on the opposing side a second time? How should I bear malice toward any, seeing that
1037	without reading or making excerpts I immediately burned all the documents that were found among the private papers both in
1037	Pompey's and in Scipio's tents? So then, let us, Conscript Fathers, boldly unite our interests, forgetting all past events as

1038	By such, statements in the senate and afterward before the people Caesar relieved them to some extent of their fears, but was not able to persuade them entirely to be of good courage until he corroborated his declarations by his deeds.
1039	The people, accordingly, were disagreeably affected by these sights that I have mentioned, and yet they deemed them very few considering the multitude of the captives and the magnitude of Caesar's accomplishments.
1040	For they made sport of those of their own number appointed to the senate by him and all the other failings of which he was
1040	accused most of all they jested about his love for Cleopatra and his sojourn at the court of Nicomedes, ruler of Bithynia,
1040	Nicomedes Caesar. inasmuch as he had once been at his court when a lad; indeed, they even declared that Caesar had enslaved the Gauls, but
1041	This was meant by them to signify that if Caesar should restore selfgovernment to the people which they regarded as just and
1041	his power, which they deemed the course of an unjust person, he would continue sole ruler. stand trial for the acts he had committed outside the laws, he would even undergo punishment; whereas, if he should cleave to
1042	On this occasion, too, he climbed up the stairs of the Capitol on his knees, without noticing at all either the chariot which

1044	Indeed, a senator named Fulvius Sepinus desired to contend in full armor, but was prevented; for Caesar had expressed a fervent wish that that should never take place, though he did permit the knights to contend.
1045	In fact they did not cease from confusion till Caesar suddenly coming upon them with his own hand seized one man and delivered him up to punishment.

1047	While Caesar was thus engaged he was also enacting many laws, passing over most of which I shall mention only those most deserving attention.
1048	After the passage of these laws he also established in their present fashion the days of the year which were not definitely
1048	sixtyseven days, all that were necessary to bring the year out even. settled among the people, since even at that time they regulated their months according to the movements of the moon by adding
1049	He got this improvement from his stay in Alexandria, save in so far as those people calculate their months as of thirty days

1050	The one day, however, which is made up of four parts Caesar introduced every fourth year, so as to have the annual seasons no longer differ at all except in the slightest degree.
1051	All these and other undertakings which he was planning for the common weal he accomplished not by independent declaration nor
1051	by independent cogitation, but he communicated everything in every instance to the heads of the senate, sometimes even to the

1053	For she had come to the city with her husband and settled in Caesar's own house, so that he too derived an ill repute from both of them.

1057	He despatched to them among others Gnaeus Pompey.
1058	As he was late in returning, the soldiers in Spain, who had learned that Scipio was dead and Didius had set sail against them,
1058	in their fear of being annihilated before Pompey came failed to wait for him; but putting at their head Titus Quintius Scapula
1058	and Quintus Aponius, Roman knights, they drove out Trebonius and led the whole Baetic nation to revolt at the same time.
1059	They had gonethus far when Pompey, recovering from his illness, arrived by sea at the mainland opposite.
1060	For Pompey, too, did what all are accustomed to do in the midst of such tumults and revolutions and especially after some of
1060	not grant the rest both by word and deed. the Allobroges had deserted, whom Juba had taken alive in a war against Curio and had given him, there was nothing that he did
1061	For though Caesar had generals in Spain, Quintus Fabius Maximus and Quintus Pedius, they did not think themselves a match for him, but remained quiet themselves, while they sent in haste for their chief.
1062	For a time matters went on so but when a few of the men sent in advance from Rome had reached there, and Caesar's arrival was
1062	looked for, Pompey became frightened; and thinking that he was not strong enough to gain the mastery of all Spain, he did not
1062	Baetica. wait for a reverse before changing his mind, but immediately, before testing the temper of his adversaries, retired into
1063	All the country at that point except the city Ulia was an ally of Pompey's this town, which had refused to submit to him, he proceeded to besiege.
1064	Meanwhile Caesar, too, with a few men suddenly came up unexpectedly not only to Pompey's followers, but even to his own soldiers.
1065	Now Caesar hoped from this very fact and his mere presence to alarm Pompey in general, and to draw him from the siege; that was why most of the army had been left behind on the road.
1066	But Pompey, thinking that one man was not much superior to another and quite confident in his own strength, was not seriously startled at the other's arrival, but continued to besiege the city and kept making assaults just as before.
1067	Hence Caesar stationed there a few soldiers from among the firstcomers and himself started for Corduba, partly because he hoped to take it by treachery, but chiefly because he expected to attract Pompey through fear for it away from Ulia.
1068	For at first Pompey left a portion of his army in position, went to Corduba and strengthened it, and as Caesar did not withstand his troops, put his brother Sextus in charge of it.
1069	However, he failed to accomplish anything at Ulia on the contrary, when a certain tower had fallen, and that not shaken down
1069	by his own men but broken down by the crowd that was making a defence from it, some few who rushed in did not come off well;
1069	and Caesar approaching lent assistance secretly by night to the citizens, and himself again made an expedition against
1069	with his entire army, a movement not destitute of results. Corduba, putting it under siege in turn then at last did Pompey withdraw entirely from Ulia and hastened to the other town
1070	For Caesar, learning of this in advance, had retired, as he happened to be sick.
1071	Caesar was at that time serving as dictator, and some time late, near the close of the war, he was appointed consul, when Lepidus, who was master of the horse, convoked the people for this purpose.
1072	Caesar, accordingly, compelled as I have said to carry on warfare even in winter did not try to attack Corduba it was strongly guarded but turned his attention to Ategua, a city in which he had learned that there was an abundance of grain.
1073	Pompey, encouraged by the nature of the country and thinking that Caesar because of the winter would not besiege the place to
1073	soldiers in the cold. any great extent, paid no heed and did not try at first to repel the assailants, since he was unwilling to injure his own
1074	Later on, when the town had been walled off and Caesar was in position before it, he grew afraid and came with assistance.
1075	He went alone by night to some of the guards as if appointed by Caesar to visit the sentries, asked and learned the password
1075	he was not known, of course, and would never have been suspected by the separate contingents of being anything but a friend

1078	would also leave him in the lurch, and chose to hazard all, although Heaven beforehand indicated his defeat very clearly.
1079	To be sure, the drops of sweat that fell from sacred statues and the confused noises of the legions, and the many animals born

1080	But the eagles of his legions shook their wings and cast forth the golden thunderbolts which some of them held in their talons thus they would hurl disaster directly at Pompey before flying off to Caesar.
1081	For Bocchus had sent his sons to Pompey and Bogud in person accompanied Caesar's force.
1082	Caesar's soldiers derived courage from their numbers and experience and above all from their leader's presence and so were anxious to be done with the war and its attendant miseries.
1083	Pompey's men were inferior in these respects, but, strong through their despair of safety, should they fail to conquer, continued zealous.
1084	Caesar and Pompey, who saw this from horseback on certain elevated positions, felt little inclination to either hope or despair, but torn with doubts were equally distressed by confidence and fear.
1085	All would have perished, or else at nightfall they would have parted with honors even, had not Bogud, who was somewhere
1085	outside the press, made an advance upon Pompey's camp, whereupon Labienus, seeing it, left his station to proceed against him.
1086	Pompey's men, interpreting this as flight, lost heart.
1087	Caesar, having thus conquered, took Corduba at once.
1088	He did not even spare the offerings to Hercules, consecrated in Gades, and he detached special precincts from some towns and laid an added tribute upon others.
1089	While Caesar was thus occupied, Pompey, who had escaped in the rout, reached the sea, intending to use the fleet that lay at anchor in Carteia, but found that it had espoused the victor's cause.
1090	Pompey himself met defeat at the hands, of Caesennius Lento, with whom he fell in he took refuge in a wood, and was there killed.
1091	Caesar, too, would doubtless have chosen to fall there, at the hands of those who were still resisting and in the glory of
1091	best friends. war, in preference to the fate he met not long after, to be cut down in his own land and in the senate, at the hands of his
1092	As Caesar did not know this, hoping that many great additional successes would fall to his own lot he acted in no moderate fashion, but was filled with loftiness as if immortal.
1093	The Parilia was honored by a perpetual horserace, yet not at all because the city had been founded on that day, but because the news of Caesar's victory had arrived the day before, toward evening.
1094	Cicero could not comprehend it, but even in the moment of defeat said "I should never have expected one so illgirt to conquer Pompey.
1095	This I have written by way of digression from story, so that no one might be ignorant of the stories about Caesar.
1096	In honor of the victory the senate passed all of those decrees that I have mentioned, and further called him "liberator", inscribed it in the records, and publicly voted for a temple of Liberty.
1097	To him first and for the first time, they then, applied, as a term of special significance, the title "imperator," not merely
1097	according to ancient custom any longer, as others besides Caesar had often been saluted as a result of wars, nor even as those
1097	granted to those who hold successively the supreme power. who have received some independent command or other authority were called, but, in short, it was this title which is now
1098	From him this title has come down to all subsequent imperatores, as something peculiar to their office, even as in Caesar's case.

1100	They offered him the magistracies, even those belonging to the people, and elected him consul for ten years, as they previously had dictator.
1101	And they commanded at that time that an ivory statue of him, but later that a whole chariot should be escorted at the horseraces along with the likenesses of the gods.
1102	Another image they set up in the temple of Quirinus with the inscription "to the invincible god", and another on the Capitol beside the former kings of Rome.
1103	It occurs to me really to marvel at the coincidence there were eight such images seven to the kings, and an eighth to the
1103	that Marcus Brutus was stirred to conspire against him. Brutus that overthrew the Tarquins besides this one, when they set up the statue of Caesar; and it was from this cause chiefly
1104	Some of them Caesar began to render operative, and of others he intended to make use in the future, no matter how much he put aside some of them.
1105	Whereas the consuls were thus disposed of, the remaining magistrates were nominally elected by the plebs and by the populace,
1105	of lots they were sent out among the provinces. in accord with ancient customs for Caesar would not accept the appointment of them, but really by him, and without the casting

1107	Nevertheless to some persons he granted ample gifts in the form of money or the sale of lands; and to a certain Lucius Basilus
1107	he allowed no rulership of a province, though the latter was praetor, but bestowed a large amount of money in place of it, so
1107	stood his ground. that Basilus became notorious both in this matter and because when insulted in the course of his praetorship by Caesar he
1108	For just as once formerly, so now in the absence of Caesar, the aediles managed all the city affairs, in conjunction with Lepidus as master of the horse.
1109	Two of the aediles managed at that time the public treasures, and one of them, by provision of Caesar, superintended the Ludi Apollinares.
1110	The next year after these events during which Caesar was at once dictator for the fifth time, taking Lepidus as master of the
1110	horse, and consul for the fifth time, choosing Antony as colleague, sixteen praetors were in power this custom indeed has
1110	also the images of Sulla and of Pompey were restored to it. remained for many years and the rostra, which was formerly in the center of the Forum, was moved back to its present position
1111	For this Caesar received praise, and again because he put upon Antony both the glory of the deed and credit for the inscription on the image.
1112	Being anxious to build a theatre, as Pompey had done, he laid the first foundations, but did not finish it.
1113	But Caesar was blamed for tearing down the dwellings and temples on the site, and likewise because he burned up the statues, all of wood, save a few, and because on finding considerable treasures of money he appropriated them all.
1114	Caesar, however, removed the ban from the survivors of those that had warred against him, granting them immunity with fair and
1114	equal terms; he promoted them to office; to the wives of the slain he restored their dowries, and to their children granted a
1114	share in the property, thus putting mightily to shame Sulla's bloodguiltiness; so that he himself enjoyed a great repute not
1114	as in war. alone for bravery, but also for uprightness, though it is generally difficult for the same man to be eminent in peace as well
1115	But while Caesar was so engaged, a longing came over all the Romans alike to avenge Crassus and those that perished with him there was some hope then, if ever, of subjugating the Parthians.
1116	The command of the war they unanimously voted to Caesar, and made ample provision for it.
1117	Nominally Caesar was to choose half of them, having a certain legal right to do this, but really he chose the whole number.
1118	For the first year, as previously, forty quaestors were elected, and then for the first time two patrician aediles and four from the people.
1119	Later he was released; some time after he was enrolled in the senate, and was now appointed praetor by Caesar; by degrees he advanced to such prominence as to conquer the Parthians and hold a triumph over them.
1120	Caesar himself intended to be dictator both years, and designated Octavius in advance as master of the horse for the second, though he was at that time a mere lad.
1121	For the time being, while this was going on, Caesar appointed Dolabella consul in his own stead, leaving Antony to finish the year out in office.

1123	This Caesar did as a preliminary step to making a campaign against the Parthians, but a baleful frenzy which fell upon certain
1123	men through jealousy of his onward progress and hatred of his being esteemed above others caused the death of the leader by

1125	In cases where a democracy has flourished anywhere, it has nevertheless reached its prime during a short period when the
1125	people had neither size nor strength that abuses should spring up among them from good fortune or jealousies from ambition.

1129	Peloponnesian isthmus, and constructing a new senatehouse, since that of Hostilius although repaired had been demolished.
1130	The reason given for that action was that a temple of Good Fortune might be built there, which Lepidus, indeed, while master
1130	of the horse had completed but the real intention was that the name of Sulla should not be preserved in it and that another

1137	uttered no insulting word and furthermore spoke well of him before the people as not desiring anything of the sort.
1138	At this time, though vexed, he remained quiet; subsequently, however, when he was riding in from Albanum, some men again
1138	called him king, and he said that his name was not king but Caesar then when those tribunes brought suit against the first man
1138	aiming at the stability of his government. that termed him king, he no longer restrained his wrath, but showed evident irritation, as if these officials were actually

1140	He did not put them to death, though some declared them worthy of that penalty, but first having removed them from the tribuneship through the motion of Helvius Cinna, their colleague, he erased their names from the senate.
1141	Caesar, however, received an ill name from this fact, too, that whereas he should have hated those that applied to him the name of king, he let them go and found fault instead with the tribunes.
1142	He answered that Jupiter alone was king of the Romans and sent the diadem to him to the Capitol, yet he was not angry and
1142	receive. caused it to be inscribed in the records that the royalty presented to him by the people through the consul he had refused to
1143	These incidents persuaded him, especially as he had displayed hostility to Caesar from the start, to attack the leader, who had nevertheless shown himself later his benefactor.
1144	After this he obtained as an associate also Gaius Cassius, who had himself been preserved by Caesar and moreover honored with a praetorship; he was the husband of Brutus's sister.
1145	For these joined in the plot against Caesar though they also had been greatly benefited by him, Decimus having been appointed consul for the second year and assigned to Hither Gaul.
1146	Caesar, however, would not receive any information about such an undertaking and punished very severely those who brought any news of the kind.
1147	A report went abroad, true or false after the manner of reports, that the socalled fifteen priests were declaring that the
1147	preparing to propose that this title be granted to Caesar. Sibyl had said the Parthians should never be captured in any other way than by a king, and the people were consequently
1148	It had been decided by them to make the attempt in the senate, for they thought that there Caesar would least expect to be
1148	harmed in any way and would so fall an easier victim, while they would possess opportunity coupled with security by having
1148	their swords instead of documents brought in boxes, and that the rest being unarmed would be unable to make any resistance.
1149	In case any one should be so rash, they expected at least that the gladiators, many of whom they had previously stationed in Pompey's Theatre under the pretext that they were to practice with arms, would assist them.
1150	The conspirators, when the appointed day had come, gathered in the senatehall at dawn and called for Caesar.
1151	The night before he was slain his wife had a vision of their house fallen in ruins, her husband wounded by some men and taking refuge in her bosom, and of Caesar being raised aloft upon the clouds and grasping the hand of Jupiter.
1152	Moreover omens not few nor indistinct crossed his path.
1153	After his assassination, finally, some recalled a weighty incident in connection with his gilded chair, that the servant, as Caesar was slow in coming, carried it out of the senate, thinking that he would have no further need of it.
1154	Caesar for this reason was so long in coming that the conspirators feared there might be a postponement a rumor circulated, indeed, that he would remain at home that day, and their plot thus fall through and they themselves be detected.
1155	This man made light of Caesar's scruples and by adding that the senate was extremely anxious to behold him, persuaded him to go forward.
1156	In brief, he was so confident that to the soothsayer who had warned him to beware of that day he said jokingly "Where are your

1160	Thereupon they attacked him from many sides at once and wounded him to death, so that by reason of their numbers Caesar was unable to say or do anything, but veiling his face was slain with many wounds.
1161	When they met in the assembly the assassins had much to say against Caesar and much in favor of the democracy, and they bade the people take courage and not expect any harm.
1162	Fearing for all that that somebody might concert measures against them the conspirators ascended the Capitoline with the avowed intention of offering prayer to the gods, and there they spent the day and night.
1163	Seeing this, Dolabella likewise did not see fit to keep quiet, but entered upon the consular office though it did not yet belong to him, and after a short speech to the people on the situation ascended the Capitol.
1164	Antony immediately after Caesar's death had fled, casting away his robe of office in order to escape notice, and had concealed himself through the night.
1165	When, however, he ascertained that the assassins were on the Capitol and Lepidus in the Forum, he assembled the senate in the precinct of Tellus and brought forward the business of the hour for deliberation.
1166	Do you not see what is taking place, that the populace is again being divided and torn asunder and that, some choosing this
1166	side, and some that, they have already fallen into two parties and two camps, that the one side has taken timely possession of
1166	the Capitol as if they feared the Gauls or somebody, and the other side with headquarters in the Forum is preparing to besiege
1166	them and so behaving like Carthaginians, and not as though they too were Romans? Do you not hear that though formerly citizens
1166	often differed, even to the extent of occupying the Aventine once, and the Capitol, and some of them the Sacred Mount, as
1166	often as they were reconciled one with another on equal terms or by yielding but a small point they at once stopped hating one
1166	another, to live the rest of their lives in such peace and harmony that in common they carried through successfully many great

1170	Do you not see how much time we have lost in fighting one another, how many great evils we have endured meanwhile, and, what
1170	is worse than that, inflicted? And who could count the vast mass of money of which we have stripped our allies and robbed the
1170	gods, which furthermore we have contributed ourselves from what we did not possess, and then expended it against one another?
1170	Or who could number the mass of men that have been lost, not only of ordinary persons that is beyond computation but of
1170	knights and senators, each one of whom was able in foreign wars to preserve the whole city by his life and death? How many
1170	Spaniards or Carthaginians, but only to perish themselves in the end. Curtii, how many Decii, Fabii, Gracchi, Marcelli, Scipiones have been killed? Not, by Jupiter, to repel Samnites or Latins or
1171	But how might one mourn as they deserve those who were pitiably destroyed in their houses, in the roads, in the Forum, in the
1171	senatechamber even, on the Capitol even, by violence not only men but also women, not only those in their prime, but also old
1171	men and children? And after subjecting one another to so many of these reprisals of such a nature as all our enemies put
1171	together never inflicted upon us nor were we ever the authors of anything similar to them, so far from loathing such acts and
1171	manfully wishing to have done with them, we rejoice and hold festivals and term those who are guilty of them benefactors.
1172	And now, since we are not only named fathers of all the people in common, but are in reality such, let us not enter into a
1172	discussion of all the fine points, lest we all incur ruin; for anybody could find much fault with Caesar himself so that he
1172	thought to deserve punishment. would seem to have been justly slain, or again might bring heavy charges against those that killed him, so that they would be
1173	Now, that none of you may suspect that I wish to grant any indulgence to Caesar's assassins to prevent their paying the penalty, just because I was once a member of Pompey's party, I will state one fact to you.
1174	I am so far from doing this that I mentioned and not looking out for the public safety, that I affirm the others, too, should

1175	Cicero by the foregoing speech persuaded the senate to vote that no one should bear malice against any one else.
1176	While this was being done the assassins also promised the soldiers that they would not undo any of Caesar's acts.
1177	They perceived that the military was mightily ill at ease for fear it should be deprived of what he had given it, and so they made haste, before the senate reached any decision whatever, to anticipate the others' wishes.
1178	Next they invited those who were present there down below to come within hearing distance, and conversed with them on matters
1178	from anybody nor do harm in other ways, and that the validity of all acts of Caesar was confirmed. of importance; as a result of the conference they sent down a letter to the Forum announcing that they would take nothing away
1179	When, therefore, the decisions of the senate also were made known, the soldiers no longer held to Lepidus nor did the others
1179	have any fear of him, but hastened to become reconciled, chiefly at the instance of Antony, quite contrary to his intention.
1180	Lepidus, making a pretence of vengeance upon Caesar, was anxious to institute a revolution and as he had legions at his

1181	No damage was inflicted or expected, and the majority were glad to be rid of Caesar's rule, some of them even conceiving the idea of casting his body out unburied.
1182	Later his will was read and the people learned that he had made Octavius his son and heir and had left Antony, Decimus, and
1182	some of the other assassins to be the young man's guardians and inheritors of the property in case it should not come to him,
1182	and furthermore that he had directed various bequests to be given to different persons, and to the city the gardens along the

1184	You yourselves have profited most by Caesar's virtues and you demand his praises not halfheartedly, as if he were no relation, but out of deep affection as one of your very own.
1185	Still, I do not now praise Caesar chiefly because he was sprung from many noble men of recent times and kings and gods of
1185	ancient days, but because in the first place he was a kinsman of our whole city, we were founded by the men that were his
1185	ancestors, and secondly because he not only confirmed the renown of his forefathers who were believed by virtue to have

1186	The gods in past times have been reported as possessing some unworthy children, but no one could deem this man unworthy to have had gods for his ancestors.
1187	Stating only the truth, therefore, I affirm that this Caesar was at the same time most able in body and most amiable in spirit.
1188	Then he saw Pompey, who had abandoned his fatherland and was setting up a kingdom of his own in Macedonia, transferring thither all your possessions, equipping your subjects against you, and using against you money of your own.
1189	So at first he wished to persuade Pompey somehow to stop and change his course and receive the greatest pledges that he should again attain a fair and equal position with him; and he sent to him both privately and publicly.
1190	When, however, he found himself unable in any way to effect this, but Pompey burst all restraints, even the relationship that
1190	had existed between himself and Caesar, and chose to fight against you, then at last he was compelled to begin a civil war.
1191	And what need is there of telling how daringly he sailed against him in spite of the winter, or how boldly he assailed him,
1191	though Pompey held all the strong positions there, or how bravely he vanquished him though much inferior in number of

1192	But this I will omit, for Caesar himself likewise never took any pride in it, but he accepted it as a dispensation of destiny, repugnant to him personally.
1193	Such exceeding humanity did he show, that he praised those who had coöperated with Pompey and allowed them to keep everything
1193	the latter had given them, but hated Pharnaces and Orodes, because though friends of the vanquished they had not assisted him.
1194	He certainly would have spared even Pompey himself if he had captured him alive.
1195	Also he was grieved to hear of Pompey's death and did not praise his murderers, but put them to death for it soon after, and even destroyed besides Ptolemy himself, though a child, because he had allowed his benefactor to perish.
1196	He was so truly a scion of gods that he understood but one thing, to save those that could be saved.
1197	Greatest of all, he burned absolutely every one of the letters containing secret information that was found in the tent of

1199	titles?"Yet this father, this high priest, this inviolable being, hero, god, is dead, alas, dead not by the violence of some

1204	Of Caesar's slayers they sent out some, who had obtained governorships, to the provinces, and the rest to various different places on one pretext or another and these persons were honored by many persons as benefactors.
1205	In this way Caesar disappeared from the scene.

1207	When, however, the excitement subsided, and Antony himself was charged with investigating the acts of Caesar's administration and carrying out all the latter's behests, he no longer kept within bounds.
1208	Moreover, he deprived some of money and offices, which in turn he gave to others, pretending that in so doing he was carrying out Caesar's directions.
1209	This was done in spite of the fact that the senate at first had voted that no tablet should be set up on account of any

1212	husband, Lucius Philippus, but on attaining maturity spent his time with Caesar. having been left without a protector by the death of his father Octavius he was brought up in the house of his mother and her
1213	He accordingly met on that occasion Octavius, who was somewhat tardy in reaching the senate on account of the birth of the child, there happened to be a meeting of the senate that day, and asked him why he was late.
1214	When he was a lad and staying in Rome Cicero dreamed that the boy was let down by golden chains to the summit of the Capitol and received a whip from Jupiter.
1215	Catulus, who had likewise never seen Octavius, beheld in a vision all the noble children on the Capitol at the termination of
1215	child's lap. a solemn procession to Jupiter, and in the course of the ceremony the god cast what looked like an image of Rome into that
1216	Startled at this he went up into the Capitol to offer prayers to the god, and finding there Octavius, who had ascended the hill for some other reason, he compared his appearance with the dream and was satisfied of the truth of the vision.
1217	Caesar founded great hopes upon him as a result of this, introduced him into the class of patricians and trained him for rulership.
1218	Now this Octavius chanced at the time that Caesar was murdered to be in Apollonia near the Ionic Gulf, pursuing his education.
1219	He had not yet heard that he had been made Caesar's son or heir, and moreover the first news he received was to the effect that the people were of one mind in the affair.
1220	When, however, he had crossed to Brundusium and had been informed about the will and the people's second thought, he made no

1221	He, too, acted in a blundering and dangerous way; he was only just past boyhood, eighteen years of age, and saw that the
1221	succession to the inheritance and the family was sure to provoke jealousy and censure yet he started in pursuit of objects
1221	that had led to Caesar's murder, and no punishment befell him, and he feared neither the assassins nor Lepidus and Antony.
1222	In this way he that was formerly called Octavius, but already at this time Caesar, and subsequently Augustus, took charge of
1222	graybeard. affairs and settled them and brought them to a successful close more vigourously than any mature man, more prudently than any
1223	Among the other injuries that Antony did him by both word and deed was his action when the lex curiata was proposed, according
1223	to which the transfer of Octavius into Caesar's family was to take place Antony himself, of course, was active to have it
1223	according to law might not meddle with the property and might be weaker in all other ways. passed, but through some tribunes he secured its postponement in order that the young man being not yet Caesar's child
1224	Caesar was restive under this treatment, but as he was unable to speak his mind freely he bore it until he had won over the crowd, by whose members he understood his father had been raised to honor.
1225	He took as an excuse the gift bequeathed by Caesar and in his speech touched upon all the important points, promising that he would discharge this debt at once, and gave them cause to hope for much besides.
1226	After this came the festival appointed in honor of the completion of the temple of Venus, which some, while Caesar was alive,
1226	had promised to celebrate, but were now holding in, slight regard as they did the horserace connected with the Parilia; and to

1227	At this time out of fear of Antony he brought into the theatre neither Caesar's gilded chair nor his crown set with precious stones, though it was permitted by decree.
1228	When, however, a certain star through all those days appeared in the north toward evening, some called it a comet, and said
1228	to mean that he had become a god and had been included in the number of the stars. that it indicated the usual occurrences; but the majority, instead of believing this, ascribed it to Caesar, interpreting it
1229	Through fear of the populace no one prevented this, and then, at last, some of the earlier decrees in regard to honors to Caesar were put into effect.
1230	For these reasons the soldiers also, and particularly since some of them received largesses of money, readily took the side of Caesar.
1231	All were exceedingly vexed, and especially because Caesar with a view to casting odium upon his rival and arousing the multitude would no longer even frequent the Forum.
1232	So Antony became terrified, and in conversation with the bystanders one day remarked that he harbored no anger against Caesar, but on the contrary owed him affection, and felt inclined to dispel the entire cloud of suspicion.
1233	Antony seeing that Caesar was gaining ground attempted to attract the populace by various baits, to see if he could detach the people from his rival and number them among his own forces.
1234	Therefore they could very easily remove those who were temporarily rulers of their allies and subjects except the majority of

1235	the reason was that it seemed to be very strong in resources of soldiers and money. previously despatched into Apollonia laid claim to Gaul on this side of the Alps, to which Decimus Brutus had been assigned;
1236	After these measures had been passed the immunity granted to Sextus Pompey by Caesar, as to all the rest, was confirmed he had already considerable influence.
1237	Later, when Caesar had started for Italy and only a small army was left behind in Baetica, he was joined both by the native
1237	suitable for the carrying on of war. inhabitants and by those who escaped from the battle, and with them he came again into Baetica, because he thought it more
1238	There he gained possession of soldiers and cities, particularly after Caesar's death, some voluntarily and some by violence; the commandant in charge of them, Gaius Asinius Pollio, held a force that was far from strong.
1239	Antony, influenced by his friendship for Lepidus and by his hostility toward Caesar, caused such a decree to be passed.
1240	Caesar and Antony in all their acts opposed each other, but had not fallen out openly, and whereas in reality they were alienated they tried to disguise the fact so far as appearances went.
1241	To a casual observer Antony, since he held the consulship, seemed to be getting the best of it, but the enthusiasm of the masses was for Caesar.
1242	This was partly on his father's account, partly on account of the hopes he held out to them, but above all because they were
1242	displeased at the considerable power of Antony and were inclined to assist Caesar while he was yet devoid of strength.
1243	After they had at this period humbled Antony through the instrumentality of Caesar they next undertook to destroy the latter also.
1244	While they were maintaining the above attitude toward Caesar and Antony, the war began as follows.
1245	Caesar sent some persons to that city with money, who were to arrive there before Antony and win over the men, and himself
1245	and city from his father, whom he said he was avenging. went to Campania, where he collected a large crowd of men, chiefly from Capua because the people there had received their land
1246	Caesar took charge of them, hastened to Rome before Antony could make his way back, and came before the people, who had been made ready for him by Cannutius.
1247	While he was doing this Antony had been at first kindly received in Brundusium by the soldiers, because they expected they would secure more from him than was offered them by Caesar.
1248	For the time being the soldiers were quiet, but on the way toward Gaul when they arrived opposite the capital they revolted, and many of them, despising the lieutenants that had been set over them, arrayed themselves on Caesar's side.
1249	The socalled Martian and the fourth legion went over to him in a body.
1250	Caesar without delay followed behind him.
1251	Decimus Brutus was at this time governor of that province, and Antony set great hopes upon him, because he had been a slayer of Caesar.
1252	Decimus did not look askance particularly at Caesar, for the latter had uttered no threats against the assassins on the other
1252	power as a result of natural acquisitiveness; therefore he refused to give ground before him. hand, he saw that Antony was no more formidable a foe than his rival, or, indeed, than himself or any of the rest who were in
1253	Caesar, when he heard this decision, was for some time at a loss what course to adopt.
1254	This proposal caused the people in the city likewise to join in expressing their gratitude to Caesar.
1255	Eulogies, however, were delivered in the senate by the members themselves and by the soldiers who had abandoned Antony, with the concurrence also of the tribunes.
1256	He, on account of his bitter and longstanding hostility toward the man, paid court to Caesar, and so far as he could, by speech and action, strove to assist him in every way and to injure Antony.
1257	In the consulship of Aldus Hirtius who was now appointed consul in spite of the fact that his father's name had been posted on
1257	successive days, including the first of the month itself. the tablets of Sulla, with his colleague Gaius Vibius, a meeting of the senate was held and votes were taken for three
1258	Ominous had been the falling of great numbers of thunderbolts, some of which descended on the shrine sacred to Capitoline Jupiter, that stood in the temple of Victory.
1259	For three men were in power, I mean Caesar and Lepidus and Antony, and of them Caesar subsequently secured the victory.
1260	At the same time that these things occurred all sorts of oracles tending to the downfall of the democracy were recited.
1261	Succeeding these terrors a plague spread over nearly the whole of Italy in a malignant form, and in view of this the senate voted that the Curia Hostilia should be rebuilt and the spot where the naval battle had taken place be filled up.
1262	These assumptions granted, a large degree of safety was afforded by Caesar both to you and to me for the discussion of pressing questions.
1263	For you would not have voted to keep the senatehouse under guard, if it had been possible for you to deliberate at all with your accustomed orderliness, and in quiet, free from fear.
1264	We shall appear to have acquired them only nominally in behalf of the city against Antony, but to have given them in reality

1265	any orders from the senate or the people, the countries which he is overrunning, the cities which he is besieging, and the
1265	hopes upon which he is building in his entire course, who would distrust, I say, the evidence of his own eyes, and to his ruin

1266	On the contrary, because he has abandoned the province of Macedonia, which was assigned to him by lot, and because he chose
1266	instead the province of Gaul, which in no way pertained to him, and because he assumed control of the legions which Caesar had
1266	sent ahead against the Parthians, keeping them about him though no danger threatens Italy, and because he has left the city

1267	On what occasion did you voluntarily abolish the commands given by Caesar or by the lot to each man, and allow this person to
1267	distribute many appointments to his friends and companions, sending his brother Gaius to Macedonia, and assigning Gaul to
1267	himself with the aid of the legions which he was not by any means keeping to use in your defence? Do you not remember how,

1271	Yet you, foreseeing this very possibility, had voted that no tablet should be set up after Caesar's death which might contain any article given by him to any person.
1272	He also said it was necessary for some provisions found in Caesar's papers to be specially noted and put into effect.
1273	Has he then shown himself such a character only in these affairs, while managing the rest rightly? In what instance? On what
1273	motive? He was ordered to search for and declare the public money left behind by Caesar, and did he not seize it, paying some
1273	of it to his creditors and spending some on high living so that he no longer has even any of this left? You hated the name of
1273	dictator on account of Caesar's sovereignty and rejected it entirely from the constitution but is it not true that Antony,
1273	though he has avoided adopting it as if the name in itself could do any harm, has exhibited the behavior belonging to it and
1273	the greed for gain, under the title of consulship? You assigned to him the duty of promoting harmony, and has he not on his
1273	own responsibility begun this great war, neither necessary nor sanctioned, against Caesar and Decimus, whom you approve?

1280	As it is, this fellow is the man who furnished him with the excuses, who destroyed the prestige of the senate, who increased the audacity of the soldiers.
1281	Now after this is there any need of mentioning that he served as master of the horse an entire year, something which had never
1281	before been done? Or that during this period also he was drunk and abusive and in the assemblies would frequently vomit the
1281	remains of yesterday's debauch on the rostra itself, in the midst of his harangues? Or that he went about Italy at the head of
1281	pimps and prostitutes and buffoons, women as well as men, in company with the lictors bearing festoons of laurel? Or that he
1281	alone of mankind dared to buy the property of Pompey, having no regard for his own dignity or the great man's memory, but
1281	other estates with the evident intention of making no recompense for them. grasping eagerly those possessions over which we even now as at that time shed a tear? He threw himself upon this and many
1282	Yet with all his insolence and violence the price was nevertheless collected, for Caesar took this way of discountenancing his act.
1283	But on the subject of the insults which he offered to the State and the assassinations which he caused throughout the whole
1283	city alike how can any man be silent? Is memory lacking of how oppressive the very sight of him was to you, but most of all
1283	his deeds? He dared, O thou earth and ye gods, first in this place, within the wall, in the Forum, in the senatehouse, on the
1283	lictors, and to be escorted by armed soldiers. Capitol, at one and the same time to array himself in the purplebordered garb, to gird a sword on his thigh, to employ
1284	Caesar, being called hither in haste to see what he was doing, did not finish entirely any of those projects, as he was surely intending.
1285	But when a man who is a Roman and a consul has dared to name any one King of the Romans in the Roman Forum, close to the
1285	rostra of liberty, in the presence of the entire people and the entire senate, and straightway to set the diadem upon his head
1285	and further to affirm falsely in the hearing of us all that we ourselves bade him say and do this, what most outrageous deed
1285	will that man not dare, and from what action, however revolting, will he refrain?Did we lay this injunction upon you, Antony,
1285	we who expelled the Tarquins, who cherished Brutus, who hurled Capitolinus headlong, who put to death the Spurii? Did we order
1285	you to salute any one as king, when we have laid a curse upon the very name of monarch and furthermore upon that of dictator
1285	as the most similar? Did we command you to appoint any one tyrant, we who repulsed Pyrrhus from Italy, who drove back
1285	Antiochus beyond the Taurus, who put an end to the tyranny even in Macedonia? No, by the rods of Valerius and the law of
1285	Porcius, no, by the leg of Horatius and the hand of Mucius, no, by the spear of Decius and the sword of Brutus! But you,

1287	What defence could any one make of what took place? That Caesar acted rightly at that time in accepting neither the name of king nor the diadem? If so, this man did wrong to offer something which pleased not even Caesar.
1288	Or, on the other hand, that the latter erred in enduring at all to look on at and listen to such proceedings? If so, and
1288	Caesar justly suffered death for this error, does not this man, admitted in a certain way that he desired a tyranny, most

1289	Seeing this, do we delay and give way to weakness and train up so monstrous a tyrant against our own selves? Is it not
1289	disgraceful that our forefathers, brought up in slavery, felt the desire for liberty, but we who have lived under an
1289	independent government become slaves of our own free will? Or again, that we were glad to rid ourselves of the dominion of
1289	Caesar, though we had first received many favors from his hands, and accept in his stead this man, a selfelected despot, who
1289	is far worse than he; this allegation is proved by the fact that Caesar spared many after his victories in war, but this

1290	words rather than by his deeds? I do not say that now for the first time is he unfriendly to us, when he has abandoned the
1290	City and made a campaign against allies and is assailing Brutus and besieging the cities; but on the basis of his former evil

1291	Surely it is a shame when Caesar, who has just emerged from boyhood and was recently registered among those having attained
1291	years of discretion, shows such great interest in the State as to spend his money and gather soldiers for its preservation

1294	Who can be unaware that this very man caused all our internal troubles and then shared the dangers to the slightest possible
1294	degree? He tarried long in Brundusium through cowardice, so that Caesar was isolated and on account of him almost failed
1294	likewise he held aloof from all succeeding wars, that against the Egyptians, against Pharnaces, the African, and the Spanish.
1295	Who is unaware that he won the favor of Clodius, and after using the latter's tribuneship for the most outrageous ends would
1295	have killed him with his own hand, if I had accepted this promise from him? Again, in the matter of Caesar, he was first
1295	associated with him as quaestor, when Caesar was praetor in Spain, next attached himself to him during the tribuneship,
1295	contrary to the liking of us all, and later received from him countless money and excessive honors in return for this he tried

1296	And I for my part do not affirm that he was the actual slayer of Caesar, not because he was not willing, but because in this, too, he was timid, yet by the very course of his actions I say that Caesar perished at his hands.
1297	Do I rejoice at the death of Caesar, I, who never enjoyed anything but liberty at his hands, and is Antony grieved, who has
1297	rapaciously seized his whole property and committed many injuries on the pretext of his letters, and is finally hastening to

1299	many of his rival's soldiers, and Brutus is keeping the same usurper out of Gaul and if you come to their assistance, first by

1305	Is not he the one who killed Clodius by the hand of Milo, and slew Caesar by the hand of Brutus? The one who made Catiline

1306	Do you not see, too, that after Caesar's death when our affairs were settled in a most tranquil way by Antony, as not even his

1306	perceived that turmoil had again arisen, he bade a long farewell to his son and to Athens, and returned? That he insults and

1308	Antony did say some words during his tribuneship in Caesar's behalf Cicero and some others spoke in behalf of Pompey.
1309	Why now does he accuse him of preferring one man's friendship, but acquit himself and the rest who warmly embraced the
1309	hindered practically everything that was known to be favorable to Caesar. opposite cause? Antony, to be sure, hindered at that time some measures adverse to Caesar from being passed and Cicero
1310	'But Antony obstructed,' he replies, 'the public judgment of the senate.
1311	' Well, now, in the first place, how could one man have had so much power? Second, if he had been condemned for this, as is said, how could he have escaped punishment? 'Oh, he fled, he fled to Caesar and got out of the way.
1312	But Antony both went away to Caesar to inform him what had been done and returned, without asking for any decree, and finally effected peace and friendship with him for all those that were found in Italy.
1313	Now in view of those circumstances do you dare to say he led Caesar against his country and stirred up the civil war and
1313	became more than any one else responsible for the subsequent evils that befell us? Not so, but you, who gave Pompey legions
1313	that belonged to others and the command, and undertook to deprive Caesar even of those that had been given him it was you, who
1313	you, who did not see Caesar even when he entered Rome, but had run off to Pompey and into Macedonia. agreed with Pompey and the consuls not to accept the offers made by Caesar, but to abandon the city and the whole of Italy
1314	Then with this on your conscience do you dare to say that Antony ought not to have held the office of master of the horse for
1314	measures to be framed, at any rate they were both passed, and they suited us and the people. a year, and that Caesar ought not to have remained dictator for a year? But whether it was wise or necessary for these
1315	Censure these men, Cicero, if they have transgressed in any particular, but not, by Jupiter, those whom they have chosen to honor for showing themselves worthy of so great a reward.
1316	For if we were forced by the circumstances that then surrounded us to act in this way and contrary to good policy, why do you
1316	afraid. now lay this upon Antony's shoulders, and why did you not oppose it then if you were able? Because, by Jupiter, you were
1317	' Why? 'Because,' he answers, 'he bought Pompey's possessions.
1318	'But Pompey's goods ought not to have been sold.
1319	' Then it was we who erred and did wrong in confiscating them; or to clear your skirts and ours it was at least Caesar who acted irregularly, he who ordered this to be done yet you did not censure him at all.
1320	He has brought against Antony two quite opposite accusations, one, that after helping Caesar in very many ways and receiving
1320	in return vast gifts from him he was then required under compulsion to surrender the price of them, and the second, that he
1320	Sicily, as if we had forgotten that he had been exiled there, and paid the price of all that he purchased. inherited naught from his father, spent all that he had like Charybdis the speaker is always bringing in some comparison from
1321	So in these charges this remarkable orator is convicted of violently contradicting himself and, by Jupiter, again in the following statements.
1322	At one time he says that Antony took part in everything that was done by Caesar and by this means became more than any one
1322	in any other exploits than those performed in Thessaly. else responsible for all our internal evils, and again he charges him with cowardice, reproaching him with not having shared
1323	For what most excessive outrages would they not have committed but for his being hedged about with these protections, when
1323	Caesar's intention the facts themselves show. some of them so despised him as it was?"That these and all his other acts were correct and most thoroughly in accord with
1324	Yet this same Antony, O thou earth, and ye gods I shall call louder than you and invoke them with greater justice, saw that
1324	the city was already in reality under a tyranny through the fact that all the legions obeyed Caesar and all the people
1324	for life and use the appurtenances of a king. together with the senate submitted to him to such an extent that they voted among other measures that he should be dictator
1325	Then he showed Caesar his error most convincingly and restrained him most prudently, until the latter, abashed and afraid,
1325	would not accept either the name of king or the diadem, which he had in mind to bestow upon himself even against our will.
1326	Antony, however, because he was thoroughly acquainted with Caesar's disposition and accurately aware of all he was preparing to do, by great good judgment succeeded in turning him aside from his course and retarding his ambitions.
1327	This is what was done, O Cicero or Cicerulus or Ciceracius or Ciceriscus or Graeculus or whatever you like to be called, by
1327	the uneducated, the naked, the anointed man and none of it was done by you, the clever, the wise, the user of much more olive
1327	of reasoning by their poses, but in order to hide the ugliness of your legs. oil than wine, you who let your clothing drag about your ankles not, by Jupiter, as the dancers do, who teach you intricacies
1328	That Antony against whom he has inveighed, seeing Caesar exalted over our government, caused him by granting what seemed personal favors to a friend not to put into effect any of the projects that he had in mind.
1329	Antony knew this thoroughly, and first of all he selected the Lupercalia and that procession in order that Caesar in the
1329	rostra that his patron might be shamed by the very places. relaxation of his spirit and the fun of the affair might be rebuked with immunity, and next he selected the Forum and the
1330	And he fabricated the commands from the populace, in order that hearing them Caesar might reflect not on what Antony was saying at the time, but on what the Roman people would order a man to say.
1331	How could he have believed that this injunction had really been laid upon any one, when he knew that the people had not voted anything of the kind and did not hear them shouting out.
1332	But it was right for him to hear this in the Roman Forum, where we had often joined in many deliberations for freedom, and
1332	beside the rostra from which we had sent forth thousands and thousands of measures in behalf of the democracy, and at the
1332	festival of the Lupercalia, in order that he should remember Romulus, and from the mouth of the consul that he might call to
1332	be tyrant not over Africans or Gauls or Egyptians, but over very Romans. mind the deeds of the early consuls, and in the name of the people, that he might ponder the fact that he was undertaking to
1333	These, then are the deeds of Antony he did not uselessly break a leg, in order himself to escape, nor burn off a hand, in

1335	What trouble did he have that would have been cured by the change of condition? What blessing did he possess that would not
1335	certainly be jeopardized by rebellion? What arms had he collected, what allies had he equipped, that a man who had been consul
1335	and was praetor should be so pitilessly and impiously cast into a cell without being allowed to say a word of defence or hear
1335	a single charge, and die there like the basest criminals? For this is what this excellent Tullius most of all desired, that in

1336	him, no, not with his own hand he is too cowardly and womanish, but by persuading and making ready others who should do it.
1337	His benefactor, Caesar, then, he slew, and as for Antony from whom he obtained personally safety and a priesthood when he was
1337	in danger of perishing at the hands of the soldiers in Brundusium, he repays him with this sort of thanks, by accusing him for
1337	others. deeds with which neither he himself nor any one else ever found any fault and attacking him for conduct which he praises in
1338	Yet he sees this Caesar, who has not attained the age yet to hold office or have any part in politics and has not been chosen
1338	to bestow, but pronounces laudations. by you, sees him equipped with power and standing as the author of a war without our vote or orders, and not only has no blame
1339	For you will find that all of Antony's acts after Caesar's demise were ordered by you.
1340	If Antony committed his many wrongs so openly and shamelessly as you say, and plundered the whole of Crete on the pretext that
1340	in accord with Caesar's letters it had been left free after the governorship of Brutus, though the latter was later given
1340	charge of it by us, how could you have kept silent and how could any one else have borne it? But these matters, as I said, I

1341	As to Macedonia and Gaul and the remaining provinces and legions, yours are the decrees, Conscript Fathers, according to which
1341	you assigned to the various governors their separate charges and delivered to Antony Gaul, together with the soldiers.
1342	Yet how much better it would have been for him then to speak in opposition, if any item of business was not going as it
1342	should, and to instruct you in these matters that are now brought forward, than to be silent at the time and allow you to make
1342	that Antony forced you to vote these measures. mistakes, and now nominally to censure Antony but really to accuse the senate!"Any sensible person could not assert, either,
1343	For since the legions had been sent ahead and united, there was fear that when they heard of Caesar's assassination they might
1343	revolt, put some inferior man at their head, and begin to wage war again so it seemed good to you, taking a proper and
1343	rejected the dictatorship entirely from the system of government. excellent course, to place in command of them Antony the consul, who was charged with the promotion of harmony, who had
1344	But even if you were then silent, tell us now at least what ought we to have done under the circumstances? Leave the legions
1344	leaderless? Would they have failed to fill both Macedonia and Italy with countless evils? Commit them to another? And whom
1344	could we have found more closely related and suited to the business than Antony, the consul, the director of all the city's
1344	for the State? Some one of the assassins, perhaps? Why, it wasn't even safe for them to live in the city. affairs, the one who had taken such good care of harmony among us, the one who had given countless examples of his affection
1345	Since these facts are so, which of the two, senators, seems to be in the wrong, Antony, who is managing the forces granted him
1345	by us, or Caesar, who is surrounded with such a large band of his own? Antony, who has departed to take up the office
1345	committed to him by us, or Brutus, who prevents him from setting foot in the country? Antony, who wishes to compel our allies
1345	to obey our decrees, or they, who have not received the ruler sent them by us but have attached themselves to the man who was
1345	voted against? Antony, who keeps our soldiers together, or the soldiers, who have abandoned their commander? Antony, who has
1345	introduced not one of these soldiers granted him by us into the city, or Caesar, who by money persuaded those who had long ago
1345	been in service to come here? I think there is no further need of argument to answer the imputation that he does not seem to
1345	have ventured on their own responsibility. be managing correctly all the duties laid upon him by us, and to show that these men ought to suffer punishment for what they
1346	Now I will tell you what advice I have to give, not favoring Antony at all nor calumniating Caesar or Brutus, but planning for the common advantage, as is proper.
1347	Wherefore I believe that we ought to treat them as friends and citizens and send messengers to all of them alike, bidding them
1347	lay down their arms and put themselves and their legions in our hands, and that we ought not yet to wage war on any one of
1347	them, but after their replies have come back approve those who are willing to obey us and fight against the disobedient.
1348	Remember that day and the speech which you delivered in the precinct of Tellus, and yield a little to this goddess of Concord
1348	from a sincere heart, or by somebody else on that occasion. under whose guidance we are now deliberating, and avoid discrediting those statements and making them appear as if not uttered
1349	Do you, therefore, if you honestly wish your country to be safe, speak and act in such a way as will both preserve yourself and not, by Jupiter, involve us in your destruction!"Such language from Calenus Cicero would not endure.
1350	On the following day and the third many other arguments were adduced on both sides, but the party of Caesar prevailed.
1351	To Antony they sent an embassy which should order him to give up the legions, leave Gaul, and withdraw into Macedonia and to
1351	enemies. his followers they issued a proclamation to return home before a given day or to know that they would occupy the position of
1352	Not long after, before learning his decision, they voted that a state of rebellion existed, changed their senatorial garb,
1352	Munatius Plancus, who was governing a portion of Transalpine Gaul, to render assistance. gave charge of the war against him to the consuls and Caesar a kind of pretorian office, and ordered Lepidus and Lucius
1353	He was pleased to receive news of the decrees and forthwith violently reproached the envoys with not treating him rightly or fairly as compared with the youth meaning Caesar.
1354	He also sent others in his turn, so as to put the blame of the war upon the senators, and make some counterpropositions which saved his face but were impossible of performance by Caesar and those who sided with him.
1355	In fine, he said that he would abandon Gaul and disband his legions, if they would grant these soldiers the same rewards as they had voted to Caesar's and would elect Cassius and Marcus Brutus consuls.
1356	Caesar would never have endured that the murderers of his father should become consuls or that Antony's soldiers by receiving the same as his own should feel still more kindly toward his rival.
1357	These subscriptions were given readily by those who favored Caesar and hated Antony.
1358	Hence they did not change their costume immediately, and persuaded the senate to send envoys again to Antony, among them
1358	should be removed from their path. Cicero in doing this they pretended that the latter might persuade him to make terms, but their real purpose was that he
1359	In the last assembly before they set out for the war a man with the socalled sacred disease fell down while Vibius was speaking.
1360	They included the following incidents the figure of the Mother of the Gods on the Palatine formerly facing the east turned
1360	around of its own accord to the west; that of Minerva held in honor near Mutina, where the most fighting was going on, sent
1360	and there is no case where this happened that the forces fared well. forth after this a quantity of blood and milk; furthermore the consuls took their departure just before the Feriae Latinae;
1361	So at this time, too, both the consuls and a vast multitude of the people perished, some immediately and some later, and also many of the knights and senators, including the most prominent.
1362	The precise reason for Antony's besieging Decimus in Mutina was that the latter would not give up Gaul to him, but he pretended that it was because Decimus had been one of Caesar's assassins.
1363	For since the true cause of the war brought him no credit, and at the same time he saw the popular party flocking to Caesar to avenge his father, he put forward this excuse for the conflict.
1364	Caesar had begun a campaign against his rival before the war was granted him by the vote, but had done nothing worthy of importance.
1365	Later he was entirely shut in by a wall; and Caesar, fearing he might be captured by storm or capitulate through lack of provisions, compelled Hirtius to join a relief party.
1366	Antony, therefore, seeing that Decimus was not inclined to yield, left him to the charge of his brother Lucius, and himself proceeded against Caesar and Hirtius.
1367	Finally the Celtic cavalry, of whom Caesar had gained possession along with the elephants, withdrew to Antony's side again.
1368	As it was, after accomplishing nothing at the first assault he began to be alarmed lest while he was delaying he should receive some setback from Caesar and the rest; so he again turned against them.
1369	For when Hirtius and Caesar perceived what was going on, the latter remained to keep watch over the camp while the former set out against Antony.
1370	Upon the latter's defeat not only Hirtius was saluted as imperator by the soldiers and by the senate, but likewise Vibius, though he had fared badly, and Caesar who had done no fighting even.
1371	Following this official action Pontius Aquila, one of the assassins and a lieutenant of Decimus, conquered in battle Titus
1371	Munatius Plancus, who opposed him; and Decimus, when a certain senator deserted to Antony, so far from displaying anger toward
1371	him sent back all his baggage and whatever else he had left behind in Mutina, the result being that the affection of many of
1371	Antony's soldiers grew cool, and some of the nations which had previously sympathized with him proceeded to rebel Caesar and
1371	was alarmed and remained quiet, but later when some reinforcements sent by Lepidus came to him he took courage. Hirtius, however, were elated at this, and approaching the fortifications of Antony challenged him to combat; he for a time
1372	Lepidus himself did not make it clear to which of the two sides he sent the army he thought well of Antony, who was a
1372	both parties, by not giving to Marcus Silanus, the commander, orders that were in the least clear. relative, but had been summoned against him by the senate; and for these reasons he made plans to have a refuge in store with
1373	Up to this time Caesar was being strengthened by the people and the senate, and because of this expected that among other honors to be bestowed he would be forthwith appointed consul.
1374	It happened that Hirtius perished in the occupation of Antony's camp and Vibius died of his wounds not long after, so that Caesar was charged with having caused their death that he might succeed to the office.
1375	But the senate had previously, while it was still uncertain which of the two would prevail, done away with all the privileges
1375	which formerly, granted to any person beyond the customs of the forefathers, had paved the way to sovereignty they voted that
1375	should be defeated. this edict should apply to both parties, intending by it to anticipate the victor, while laying the blame upon the other, who
1376	Nor did they propose that Caesar any longer should receive any great reward, but even undertook to overthrow him, by allowing Decimus to secure all the prizes for which he was hoping.
1377	They voted Decimus not only the right of sacrifice but a triumph and gave him charge of the rest of the war and of the legions, those of Vibius and others.
1378	Upon the soldiers that had been besieged with him they resolved that eulogies should be bestowed and all the other rewards
1378	beheld it from the walls. which had formerly been offered to Caesar's men, although these troops had contributed nothing to the victory, but had merely
1379	In a word, practically every advantage that had been given Caesar against Antony was voted to others against the man himself.
1380	To Sextus Pompey they entrusted the fleet, to Marcus Brutus Macedonia, and to Cassius Syria together with the war against Dolabella.
1381	Those charged with these commissions also they sent not to Caesar but to the men in the field.
1382	Those who had been preferred in honor were not so delighted at this precedence as they were suspicious of the affair, particularly as a result of Caesar's influence.
1383	The people in the City, on learning this, though frightened did not even so appoint him consul, for which he was most anxious,
1383	but granted him the distinction of consular honors, so that he might now record his vote along with the exconsuls.
1384	In this way did they think they had handled Caesar cleverly as if he were in reality a mere youth and child, as they were always repeating.
1385	With Antony he secretly arranged a truce, and he assembled the men who had escaped from the battle, whom he himself had
1385	people. conquered and the senate had voted to be enemies, and in their presence made many accusations against both the senate and the
1386	The people in the City on hearing this for a time held him in contempt, but when they heard that Antony and Lepidus had become
1386	assigned to him charge of the war against the two. of one mind they began again to court his favor, for they were in ignorance of the propositions he had made to Antony, and
1387	Caesar was accordingly ready to accept even this if he could be made consul for it.
1388	When he was not even then chosen, he made preparations, to be sure, to carry on war, as had been decreed, but meanwhile
1388	that had been Caesar's. arranged that his own soldiers of their own motion, of course should suddenly take an oath not to fight against any legion
1389	So he waited and sent as envoys to the senate on this business four hundred of the soldiers themselves.
1390	This was the excuse that they had for an embassy, but in addition they demanded the money that had been voted them and urged that Caesar be appointed consul.
1391	While the senators were postponing their reply, which required deliberation, as they said, they asked naturally on the instructions from Caesar that amnesty be granted to some one who had embraced Antony's cause.
1392	Then they openly showed their anger, and one of them issued from the senatechamber and grasping a sword they had gone in unarmed said "If you do not grant the consulship to Caesar, this shall grant it.
1393	Caesar did not censure the soldier's act, but made a complaint because they had been obliged to lay aside their arms on entering the senate and because one of them was asked whether they had been sent by the legions or by Caesar.
1394	The senators on ascertaining their approach sent them their money before they came near, hoping that when the invaders received that they might retire, and when they still pressed on they appointed Caesar consul.
1395	Learning of this the senate altered its policy and bade the host not approach the city but remain over one hundred and fifty stadia from it.
1396	While Caesar was still on the march this was the condition of things; and all the people who were at that time in Rome with
1396	taste of dangers. one accord sought a share in the proceedings, as the majority of men are wont to be bold until they come in sight and have a
1397	When, however, he arrived in the suburbs, they were alarmed, and first some of the senators, later many of the people, went over to his side.
1398	Thus Caesar took possession of the city without a blow and was appointed consul also by the people, though two proconsuls were
1398	merely to superintend the comitia, because many men who held the curule offices were absent from the city. chosen to hold the elections; it was impossible, according to precedent, for an interrex to be created for so short a period
1399	Caesar, that he might appear to not to have used any force upon them, did not enter the assembly, as if it was his presence that any one feared instead of his power.
1400	For, comparing it with Romulus and the omen that had befallen the latter, he began to expect that he should obtain his sovereignty.
1401	The emperor Severus was the first to change it; for he honored Plautianus with the consular honors and afterward introduced him to the senate and appointed him consul, proclaiming that he was entering the consulship the second time.
1402	Caesar, accordingly, arranged affairs in general in the city to suit his taste, and gave money to the soldiers, to some what
1402	reality from the public store. had been voted from the funds prescribed, and to the rest individually from his private funds, as the story went, but in
1403	Caesar while giving the soldiers the money also expressed to them his fullest and sincerest thanks.
1404	He did not even venture to enter the senatechamber without a guard of them.
1405	To the senate he showed gratitude, but it was all fictitious and pretended.
1406	To him on whom they had threatened to inflict penalties, because he had gathered forces on his own responsibility without the
1406	they had ordered Decimus to fight with Antony they added Decimus's legions. passing of any vote, they assigned the duty of collecting others and to the man for whose disenfranchisement and overthrow
1407	Finally he obtained the guardianship of the city, so that he was able to do everything that he wished according to law, and he was adopted into Caesar's family in the regular way, as a consequence changing his name.
1408	He had, as some think, been even before this accustomed to call himself Caesar, as soon as this name was bequeathed to him together with the inheritance.
1409	He was not, however, exact about his title, nor did he use the same one in dealing with everybody until at this time he had
1409	Octavianus. ratified it in accordance with ancestral custom, and was thus named, after his famous predecessor, Gaius Julius Caesar
1410	This is the status of the matter, but I shall call him not Octavianus but Caesar, because this name has prevailed among all such as secure dominion over the Romans.
1411	That one will be given when it comes up in the history, but until then the title Caesar will be sufficient to show that Octavianus is indicated.
1412	This Caesar, then, as soon as he had conciliated the soldiers and enslaved the senate, turned himself to avenging his father's murder.
1413	Consequently they were convicted by default, and not only those who had been the actual murderers of Caesar and their fellowconspirators, but many others who so far from plotting against Caesar, had not even been in the city at the time.
1414	This action was directed chiefly against Sextus Pompey.
1415	The provinces, not only those which some of them were governing, but all the rest, were committed to the friends of Caesar.
1416	He had suspected Caesar's purpose in advance, before he entered the city, and had quietly slipped away.
1417	Now the assassins of Caesar had many accusers who were anxious to ingratiate themselves with his son, and many who were persuaded so to act by the rewards offered.
1418	Of the jurors the majority voted against the accused out of fear of Caesar and a wish to please him, generally hinting that they were justified in doing this.
1419	Some cast their votes in consideration of the law enacted about punishing the culprits, and others in consideration of the arms of Caesar.
1420	He made a great boast of this at the time and secretly received approval from the rest that he was not immediately put to death gained for Caesar a great reputation for toleration, but later he was executed as the result of a proscription.
1421	After accomplishing this Caesar's next step was naturally a campaign against Lepidus and Antony.
1422	Antony on fleeing from the battle described had not been pursued by Caesar on account of the war being entrusted to Decimus; and the latter had not pursued because he did not wish a rival to Caesar to be removed from the field.
1423	They might have entered Italy with their arms, had they wished, for the decrees by this time exerted a very weak influence

1425	But when he ascertained Antony's agreement with Caesar, he then came to terms with both of them himself.
1426	For this the senate voted eulogies and a statue to Juventius and a public funeral, but Lepidus they deprived of his image which stood upon the rostra and made him an enemy.
1427	Furthermore they changed their clothing again, they had resumed citizen's apparel in honor of Caesar's consulship, and summoned Marcus Brutus and Cassius and Sextus to proceed against them.
1428	When the latter seemed likely to be too slow in responding, they committed the war to Caesar, being ignorant of the conspiracy existing.
1429	Accordingly, even against his will he kept his covenant with them and directed his efforts to effecting a reconciliation for them with the senate and with the people.
1430	He did not secure this, however, until the senate had communicated it to the supposedly ignorant Caesar and he had unwillingly agreed to it, compelled, as he alleged, by the soldiers.
1431	Learning, however, of his own condemnation and of their reconciliation he wished to lead a campaign against Caesar, but was abandoned by Plancus who favored the cause of Lepidus and Antony.
1432	But they embraced Caesar's cause, and the rest were pursued by Lepidus and Antony and then were won over through the agency of others.
1433	Antony and Lepidus left lieutenants in Gaul and themselves proceeded to join Caesar in Italy, taking with them the larger and the better part of their armies.
1434	They also hoped to become masters of whatever they desired, of Caesar and the rest in the City, by the size of their armies.
1435	They were met near Bononia by Caesar with many soldiers he was exceedingly well prepared to defend himself against them, if they should offer any violence.
1436	But to prevent its appearing that they were headed straight toward an oligarchy and so envy and opposition arise on the part
1436	and settlement of affairs. of the people at large, the three were to be chosen in common as a kind of commissioners and correctors for the administration
1437	This office was not to be perpetual, but for five years, under the general proviso that they should manage all questions,
1437	whomsoever they pleased. whether they made any communication about them to the people and the senate or not, and give the offices and other honors to
1438	The private arrangement, however, in order that they should not be thought to be appropriating the entire sovereignty, was
1438	of Gaul south and north of the Alps to Antony to rule. that both Libyas, Sardinia, and Sicily should be given to Caesar, all of Spain and Gallia Narbonensis to Lepidus, and the rest
1439	Meanwhile the soldiers of Antony, of course at the latter's direction, committed to Caesar's charge the daughter of Fulvia Antony's wife, whom she had by Clodius, and this in spite of Caesar's being already betrothed to another.
1440	Among other points for his reflection was his knowledge that his father Caesar had not failed to carry out all of his plans against Pompey, in spite of the relationship between the two.
1441	DIO'S ROMAN HISTORY  The following is contained in the Fortyseventh of Dio's Rome How Caesar, Antony, and Lepidus came to Rome
1441	and instituted a reign of slaughter chapters About Brutus and Cassius and what they did before the battle of Philippi chapters
1441	How Brutus and Cassius were defeated by Caesar and perished chapters Duration of time, the remainder of the consulship of

1442	In Caesar's case at the very time after the covenant had been made an eagle settled upon his tent and killed two crows that attacked it and tried to pluck out its feathers, a sign which granted him victory over his two rivals.
1443	So they came to Rome, first Caesar, then the others, each one separately, with all their soldiers, and immediately through the tribunes enacted such laws as pleased them.
1444	Consequently sacrifices were voted for them as if for good fortune and the people changed their attire as if they had secured prosperity, although they were considerably terrified by the transactions and still more by omens.
1445	Another reason for their faring worse on this occasion than before was that previously only Sulla's own enemies and the foes
1445	of the leaders associated with him were destroyed among his friends and the people in general no one perished at his bidding;
1445	courage. so that except the very wealthy, and these can never be at peace with the stronger element at such a time, the remainder took
1446	Indeed, Lucius Caesar, Antony's uncle, had become his enemy, and Lepidus's brother, Lucius Paulus, hostile to him.
1447	They had been honored by the former Caesar for a very long time and as they had been in office and holding governorships most of the period they had many enemies.
1448	It appeared as if Caesar had a part in the business merely because of his sharing the authority, for he himself was not at all anxious to kill any large number.
1449	Later she waited for a national festival, which a relative of hers was to direct, and through the influence of his sister Octavia brought it about that Caesar alone of the three entered the theatre.
1450	Caesar, astonished, released all of them death being the penalty also for such as concealed any one and enrolled Philopoemen among the knights.
1451	He had been chosen formerly to command the fleet and had held sway for some time on the sea, so that he had surrounded himself with a force of his own, though he was afterward deprived of his office by Caesar.
1452	And to the populace they once openly stated that they had emulated neither the cruelty of Marius and Sulla so as to incur hatred, nor the mildness of Caesar so as to be despised and as a result become objects of a conspiracy.
1453	Caesar resigned the office of consul, giving up willingly that which he had so desired as to make war for it, and his
1453	praetorship they promoted one of the aediles. colleague gave up his place, whereupon they appointed Publius Ventidius, though praetor, and one other; and to the former's
1454	They did not, to be sure, lay claim to titles which were offensive and had been therefore done away with, but they managed matters according to their own wish and desire, so that Caesar's sovereignty by comparison appeared all gold.
1455	To such an extent were they filled with greed and shamelessness that one man asked from Caesar himself the property of Attia, Caesar's mother, who had died at the time and had been honored by a public burial.
1456	While these three men were behaving in this wise, they were also magnifying the former Caesar to the greatest degree.
1457	In case news of a victory came from anywhere they assigned the honor of a thanksgiving to the victor by himself and to Caesar, though dead, by himself.
1458	They compelled everybody to celebrate his birthday wearing laurel and in good spirits, passing a law that all others,
1458	of denarii. neglected it, were accursed before Jupiter and before him while any senators or their sons should forfeit twentyfive myriads
1459	Now it happened that the Ludi Apollinares fell on the same day, and they therefore voted that his natal feast should be held
1459	twentyfour hours to any god except Apollo. on the previous day, because they said there was an oracle of the Sibyl forbidding a festival to be celebrated during that
1460	Besides granting him these privileges they regarded the day on which he had been murdered on which there was always a regular meeting of the senate as a dies nefas.
1461	Besides, they forbade any likeness of him, because he was in very truth a god, to be carried at the funerals of his relatives, which ancient custom was still being observed.
1462	And they enacted that no one who took refuge in his shrine to secure immunity should be banished or stripped of his goods, a right given to no one of the gods even, save to such as had a place in the days of Romulus.
1463	In addition to those gifts to Caesar they allowed the vestal virgins to employ one lictor each, because one of them had been insulted, owing to not being recognized, while returning home from dinner toward evening.
1464	When this had been accomplished, Lepidus remained there, as I have said, to take up the administration of the City and of the rest of Italy, and Caesar and Antony started on their campaign.
1465	But when some began to be displeased at the killing of Caesar, they withdrew, pretending to be in haste to reach the governorships abroad to which they had been appointed.
1466	And in their capacity as praetors they sent a certain number of letters to Rome to the people, until such time as Caesar Octavianus began to aspire to public position and to win the affections of the populace.
1467	Meanwhile, learning that Caesar was making progress they neglected the Cretans and Bithynians, to whom they were directing
1467	their course, for among them they saw no aid forthcoming worthy the name but they turned to Syria and to Macedonia, which did
1467	not, to be sure, appertain to them in the least, because they were teeming with money and troops for the occasion.
1468	The departing official embraced his cause at once, and Antonius was weak, being hindered by Caesar's supremacy in Rome from performing any of the duties belonging to his office.
1469	Close upon this success the victor acquired all of Macedonia and Epirus, and then despatched a letter to the senate, stating what had been accomplished, and placing himself, the provinces, and the soldiers at its disposal.
1470	The senators, who by chance already felt suspicious of Caesar, praised him strongly and bade him govern all that region.
1471	For a time he communicated with Caesar, when the latter appeared to be hostile to Antony, urging him to resist his enemy and be reconciled with him Brutus, and he was making preparations to sail to Italy because the senate summoned him.
1472	After Caesar, however, had matters thoroughly in hand in Rome, and proceeded openly to take vengeance on his father's slayers,
1472	Brutus remained where he was, deliberating how he should successfully ward off the other's attack when it occurred and besides
1472	a state of discontent by Antonius. managing admirably the other districts as well as Macedonia, he calmed the minds of his legions when they had been thrown into
1473	His easy escapes, however, did not improve him at all, and he deserted his benefactors to join Caesar and Antony.
1474	On the way he took charge of the territory which had belonged to Sadalus who died childless and left it to the Romans, and
1474	invaded the country of the Bessi, to see if he could at the same time recompense them for the trouble they were causing and
1474	Antony. surround himself with the name and reputation of imperator, which would enable him to fight more easily against Caesar and
1475	As a result he brought Tarcondimotus and the people of Tarsus into the alliance, though they were reluctant.
1476	For the Tarsians were so devoted to the former Caesar and out of regard for him to the second also that they had changed the name of their city to Juliopolis after him.
1477	This done, Cassius went to Syria, and without striking a blow assumed entire direction of the nations and the legions.
1478	Caecilius Bassus, a knight, who had made the campaign with Pompey and in the retreat had arrived at Tyre, continued to spend his time there, incognito.
1479	Now Sextus was governing the Syrians, for Caesar, since he was quaestor and also a relative of his, had entrusted to his care all Roman interests in that quarter on the occasion of his own march from Egypt against Pharnaces.
1480	So Bassus at first remained quiet, satisfied to be allowed to live when, however, some similar persons had associated
1480	themselves with him and he had attracted to his enterprise various soldiers of Sextus who at various times came there to
1480	garrison the city, and likewise many alarming reports kept coming in from Africa about Caesar, he was no longer pleased with
1480	or to clothe himself in some authority. existing circumstances but raised a rebellion, his aim being either to help the followers of Scipio and Cato and the Pompeians
1481	So after this he forged an epistle, which he pretended had been sent to him by Scipio, in which he announced that Caesar had been defeated and had perished in Africa and stated that the governorship of Syria had been assigned to him.
1482	The troops of Antistius were increased by such persons in the vicinity as favored Caesar and soldiers that had been sent by him from Rome, those of Bassus by Alchaudonius the Arabian.
1483	Things were in this condition among them when Cassius came on the scene and at once conciliated all the cities through the
1483	without additional labor. reputation of what he had done in his quaestorship and his other fame, and attached the legions of Bassus and of the rest
1484	Having secured possession of Syria he set out into Judea on learning that the followers of Caesar left behind in Egypt were approaching.
1485	Thus did Cassius in brief time become strong and he sent a despatch to Caesar about reconciliation and to the senate about the situation, couched in similar language to that of Brutus.
1486	Therefore the senate confirmed his governorship of Syria and voted for the war with Dolabella.
1487	When his dupe became in this way imbued with confidence and ceased to be on his guard, Dolabella by night suddenly seized Smyrna, where the other was, slew him, and hurled his head at Caesar's image, and thereafter occupied all of Asia.
1488	When the Romans at home heard of this they declared war against him; for as yet Caesar had neither conquered Antony nor obtained a hold upon affairs in the City.
1489	Dolabella, accordingly, after becoming in this way master of Asia came into Cilicia while Cassius was in Palestine, took over
1489	the people of Tarsus with their consent, conquered a few of Cassius's guards who were at Aegeae, and invaded Syria.
1490	From Antioch he was repulsed by the contingent guarding the place, but gained Laodicea without a struggle on account of the friendship which its inhabitants felt for the former Caesar.
1491	Upon this he spent some days in acquiring new strength, the fleet among other reinforcements came to him speedily from Asia, and crossed over into Aradus with the object of getting both money and ships from the people also.
1492	While this was going on the people of Tarsus had attempted to keep from the passage through the Taurus Tillius Cimber, an assassin of Caesar who was then governing Bithynia and was hurrying forward to help Cassius.
1493	As a result, the people of Tarsus received praise from the triumvirate, who now held sway in Rome, and were inspired with hope of obtaining some return for their losses.
1494	This son, whom she named Ptolemy, she also pretended was sprung from Caesar, and she was therefore wont to address him as Caesarion.
1495	As they had a like responsibility for the war and looked forward to a like danger and did not even now recede from their

1498	Next Brutus came to Patara and invited the people to conclude friendship; but they would not obey, for the slaves and the
1498	of debts, prevented any compact being made. poorer portion of the free population, who had received in advance for their services the former freedom, the latter remission
1499	The people of Myra took the same action when after capturing their general at the harbor he then released him.
1500	Accomplishing nothing, however, they were rather careful to keep their camp well guarded than to expose it to danger, and sent in haste for Caesar and Antony.
1501	Both, however, encountered a delay of some time, Antony near Brundusium, because blocked by Staius, and Caesar near Rhegium, having first turned aside to meet Sextus, held Sicily and was making an attempt on Italy.
1502	Caesar fell sick and was left behind at Dyrrachium, while Antony marched for Philippi.
1503	Caesar heard of it and feared either possible outcome, that his colleague should be defeated in a separate attack or again
1503	would have it all himself; therefore he made haste though still unwell. that he should conquer in the former event he felt that Brutus and Cassius would attain power, and in the latter that Antony
1504	For some time, however, no ordered battle was joined, although Caesar and Antony were exceedingly anxious to bring on a conflict.
1505	Because they were lovers of the people in no pretended sense and were contending with citizens, they consulted the interests
1505	of the latter no less than those of their own associates, and desired to afford preservation and liberty to both alike.
1506	Hence the people never attained again to the absolute right of free speech, in spite of being vanquished by no foreign nation

1507	I do not say that the people's defeat at that time was not beneficial.
1508	What else can one say regarding those who fought on both sides than that the Romans were conquered and Caesar was victorious?

1509	Thunderbolts descended on many spots, and most significantly upon the altar of Jupiter Victor; flashes darted hither and
1509	located close together beside the Tiber. thither; notes of trumpets, clashing of arms, and cries of camps were heard by night from the gardens of Caesar and of Antony,
1510	The chariot of Minerva while returning to the Capitol from a horserace was dashed to pieces, and the statue of Jupiter at Albanum sent forth blood at the very time of the Feriae from its right shoulder and right hand.
1511	This was what took place in Rome, where certain oracles also both before the events and pertaining to them were recited, tending to the downfall of the democracy.
1512	To that party these signs brought evil, while the others, so far as we know, were visited by no omen, but saw some such, visions as the following in dreams.
1513	A Thessalian dreamed that the former Caesar had bidden him tell Caesar that the battle would occur on the second day after
1513	immediately put his father's ring on his finger and wore it often afterward. that one, and that he should resume some of the insignia which his predecessor wore while dictator Caesar therefore
1514	That was the vision which that man saw, whereas the physician who attended Caesar thought that Minerva enjoined him to lead
1514	his patient, though still in poor health, from his tent and place him in line of battle and by this act he was saved.
1515	In most cases safety is the lot of such as remain in the camp and of those in the fortifications, while danger accompanies those who proceed into the midst of weapons and battles; but this was reversed in the case of Caesar.
1516	And if all had contested with all, as may happen under such circumstances, or if Brutus had been arrayed against Antony and Cassius against Caesar, they would have proved equally matched.
1517	As it was, Brutus forced the invalid Caesar from his path, while Antony overruled Cassius, who was by no means his equal in warfare.
1518	This was shown first by the fact that the entire ramparts of Caesar and Antony and everything within them had been captured.
1519	That proved practically the truth of the dream, for if Caesar had remained in his place, he would certainly have perished with the rest.
1520	Caesar and Antony were getting short of both food and money, and consequently gave their soldiers nothing to replace what had been seized and carried off.
1521	He uttered aloud this sentence of Heracles"Unhappy Virtue, thou wert but a name, while I,Deeming thy godhead real, followed thee on,Who wert but Fortune's slave.

1523	So perished Brutus and Cassius, slain by the swords with which they had despatched Caesar.
1524	Caesar and Antony for the moment secured an advantage over Lepidus, because he had not shared the victory with them; yet they were destined ere long to turn their arms against each other.
1525	They immediately redistributed the empire, so that Spain and Numidia fell to Caesar, Gaul and Africa to Antony; they further agreed that in case Lepidus showed any vexation at this Africa should be evacuated for him.
1526	So, leaving these other regions to be common property, Antony took it upon himself to settle affairs of nations that had
1526	fought against them and to collect the money which had been offered to the soldiers in advance Caesar was charged with
1526	curtailing the power of Lepidus, if he should make any hostile move, with conducting the war against Sextus, and with
1526	dismissed. assigning to those of his campaigners who had passed the age limit the land which he had promised them; and these he forthwith
1527	Furthermore he sent with Antony two legions of his followers, and his colleague sent word that he would give him in return an equal number of those stationed at that tune in Italy.
1528	Thereupon Antony set out for Asia and Caesar for Italy.
1529	This Caesar ordered them outright to do in gratitude for vengeance upon the assassins.
1530	Wherefore Caesar, in dread that they might take some rebellious step, especially since Lepidus was there, forwarded a letter
1530	way, after the manner of his father. to the senate urging its members to be of good cheer, and further promising that he would do everything in a mild and humane
1531	She, the motherinlaw of Caesar and wife of Antony, had no respect for Lepidus because of his slothfulness, and herself managed affairs, so that neither the senate nor the people dared transact any business contrary to her pleasure.
1532	Actually, when Lucius himself was anxious to have a triumph over certain peoples dwelling in the Alps, on the ground that he
1532	had conquered them, for a time Fulvia opposed him and no one would grant it; but when her favor was courted and she permitted
1532	it, all voted for the measure therefore it was nominally Antonius.. over the people whom he said he had vanquished in reality

1533	Moreover he exalted himself even above his predecessor, saying that he had voluntarily laid aside the decorations of the procession and had assembled the senate in his street dress, whereas Marius had done it unwillingly.
1534	He added that the latter had received a crown from almost nobody, whereas he obtained many, and particularly from the people, tribe by tribe, as had never been the case with any former triumphator.
1535	It was in this year that Caesar arrived in Rome, and, after taking the usual steps to celebrate the victory, turned his attention to the administration and despatch of business.
1536	As time went on they became at variance, the persons just mentioned because they did not get a share in the portion of lands to be assigned which belonged to Antony, and Caesar because he did not get back his troops from the other two.
1537	Caesar would not endure the domineering ways of his motherinlaw, and, choosing to appear to be at odds with her rather than with Antonius, sent back her daughter, whom he declared on oath to be still a virgin.
1538	Lucius together with Fulvia attempted to get control of affairs, pretending to be doing this in behalf of Marcus, and would
1538	yield to Caesar on no point therefore on account of his devotion to his brother he took the additional title of Pietas.
1539	Caesar naturally found no fault with Marcus, not wishing to alienate him while he was attending to the nations in Asia, but
1539	were eager for individual supremacy. reproached and resisted the pair, giving out that they were behaving in all respects contrary to their brother's desire and
1540	Caesar for his part wished to distribute the territory to all such as had made the campaign with himself and Antony, according
1540	to the compact made with them after the victory, that by so doing he might win their goodwill the others demanded to receive
1540	these settlements on their side. the assignment that appertained to their party and settle the cities themselves, in order that they might get the power of
1541	For at first Caesar was for taking from the possessors and giving to the veterans all of Italy except what some old campaigner
1541	had received as a gift or bought from the government and was now holding, together with the bands of slaves and other wealth.
1542	Next they took some of them individually, aided and united them, so that the men who were before afraid of Caesar now that
1542	approve their course. they had got leaders became courageous and no longer gave up any of their property they thought that Marcus, too, would
1543	Among these, therefore, Lucius and Fulvia secured a following, and still made no assault upon the adherents of Caesar.
1544	In this way it quickly came about that Caesar, who had forcibly robbed the possessors of any property and caused troubles and
1544	dangers on account of it to all alike, found himself disliked by both parties; whereas the other two, since they took nothing
1544	assets and without a combat, won over each of the bodies of men. from anybody and showed those who were to receive the gifts a way to the fulfillment of the pledges from already existing
1545	As a result of this and through the famine which was trying them greatly at this time, because the sea off Sicily was in
1545	dilemma. control of Sextus, and the Ionian Gulf was in the grasp of Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus, Caesar found himself in a considerable
1546	There was not only this to trouble Caesar greatly but also the fact that in the disputes which had been inaugurated between
1546	the exsoldiers and the senators as well as the rest of the multitude that possessed lands, and these proved very numerous
1546	because the contestants were struggling for the greatest interests, he could not attach himself to either side without danger.
1547	And as a result he continued to offend either this group or the other, at one time reproached with being a friend of the people and again with being a friend of the army.
1548	When this was done the senate and the rest, finding nothing taken from them, became fairly resigned to his rule, but the
1548	they were to receive less. veterans were indignant, regarding his sparingness and the honor shown to the others to be their own dishonor and loss, since
1549	They killed not a few of the centurions and the other intimates of Caesar who tried to restrain them from mutiny, and came very near compassing their leader's own destruction, using every plausible excuse possible for their anger.
1550	This measure caused the soldier element to become somewhat more conciliatory, but that very thing produced vexation again among the people.
1551	When this took place constantly and soldiers sent ahead by Caesar into Spain made a kind of uprising at Placentia and did not
1551	come to order until they received money from the people there, and they were furthermore hindered from crossing the Alps by

1552	conduct all her deliberations with their help, even sending orders to whatever points required it. detaching them from Caesar, while Fulvia occupied Praeneste, had senators and knights for her associates, and was wont to

1553	they filled every one with hope. far inferior to them not only in troops, but in goodwill on the part of the population; for he caused many distress, whereas
1554	But his opponents in the first place made many counterpropositions, demands with which Caesar was sure not to comply, and again, in respect to everything that they did said they were doing it by the orders of Mark Antony.
1555	Thereupon these assembled in Rome in great numbers, with the avowed intention of making some communication to the people and the senate.
1556	But instead of troubling themselves about this errand they collected on the Capitol and commanded that the compacts which Antony and Caesar made be read to them.
1557	To Caesar, who was present, and to the other party by an embassy they gave orders to meet for adjudication at Gabii on a stated day.
1558	Caesar showed his readiness to submit to arbitration, and the others promised to put in an appearance, but out of fear or else perhaps disdain did not come.
1559	So they condemned Lucius and Fulvia as guilty of some injustice, and gave precedence to the cause of Caesar.
1560	Caesar, then, was making preparations, and Fulvia and Lucius were gathering hoards of supplies and assembling forces.
1561	Caesar made an expedition against Nursia, among the Sabini, and routed the garrison encamped before it but was repulsed from the city by Tisienus Gallus.
1562	On ascertaining this Caesar left Quintus Salvidienus Rufus to look after the people of Sentinum, and himself set out for Rome.
1563	Thus Caesar was received into the capital without striking a blow, and when he did not capture the other by pursuit, he returned and kept a more careful watch over the city.
1564	Meantime, as soon as Caesar had left Sentinum, Gaius Furnius the guarder of the fortifications had issued forth and pursued
1564	him a long distance, and Rufus unexpectedly attacked the citizens within, captured the town, plundered, and burned it.
1565	The inhabitants of Nursia came to terms and suffered no ill treatment; when, however, after burying those that had fallen in
1565	the battle which had taken place between themselves and Caesar, they inscribed on their tombs that they had died contending
1565	for liberty, an enormous fine was imposed upon the people, so that they abandoned their city and entire country together.
1566	There he was cut off first by the lieutenants of Caesar and later by Caesar himself, and was besieged.

1570	When that city had been captured during the consulship of Gnaeus Calvinus and Asinius Pollio, the former holding office the second time, other posts in Italy partly perforce and partly voluntarily capitulated to Caesar.
1571	He was holding a kind of fort in Campania, and when Caesar's party got the upper hand set out with his wife Livia Drusilla and with his son Tiberius Claudius Nero.
1572	This Livia who then fled from Caesar later on was married to him, and this Tiberius who then escaped with his parents succeeded him in the office of emperor.
1573	At that time the inhabitants of Rome resumed the garb of peace, which they had taken off without any decree, under compulsion
1573	from the people; they gave themselves up to merrymaking, conveyed Caesar in his triumphal robe into the city and honored him
1573	with a laurel crown, so that he enjoyed this decoration as often as the celebrators of triumphs were accustomed to use it.
1574	Caesar, when Italy had been subdued and the Ionian Gulf had been cleared, for Domitius despairing of continuing to prevail any longer by himself had sailed away to Antony, made preparations to proceed against Sextus.
1575	Sextus, after he had originally left Spain according to his compact with Lepidus and not much later had been appointed admiral, was removed from his office by Caesar.
1576	For all that he held on to his fleet and had the courage to sail to Italy; but Caesar's adherents were already securing control of the country and he learned that he had been numbered among the assassins of Caesar's father.
1577	As he had not taken part in the murder he expected to be restored by Caesar himself.
1578	When, however, his name was exposed on the tablet and he knew that the edict of proscription was in force against him also, he despaired of getting back through Caesar and put himself in readiness for war.
1579	While he was thus growing strong, Caesar for a time took no action in the matter, both because he despised him and because the business in hand kept him occupied.
1580	But when owing to the famine the deaths in the City became numerous and Sextus commenced to make attempts on Italy also, Caesar began to have a small fleet equipped and sent Salvidienus Rufus with a large force ahead to Rhegium.
1581	This took place in the course of Caesar's expedition into Macedonia, and he himself was an eyewitness of the battle; the result filled him with chagrin, most of all because he had been defeated in this their first encounter.
1582	For these reasons and because he gave the exiles a refuge, was negotiating friendship with Antony, and plundering a great portion of Italy, Caesar felt a wish to become reconciled with him.
1583	This person was praetor at the time, holding a brilliant position in many ways because he was such an intimate friend of
1583	of the nobility, which added to his glory. Caesar, and for two days he had been conducting the horserace and enjoyed the socalled "Troy contest," carried on by children
1584	Caesar had formerly tried, as has been described, to get possession of Gaul through others, but had not been able on account of Calenus and the rest who followed Antony's fortunes.
1585	The governors, before the union of the three men, were Titus Sextius over the Numidian region, and Cornificius with Decimus Laelius over the rest; the former was friendly to Antony, the latter two to Caesar.
1586	When this had been accomplished, Sextius occupied Africa and governed both provinces without interference, until Caesar
1586	to take charge of the people; then the governor voluntarily gave up the provinces. according to the covenant made by him with Antony and Lepidus took possession of the office and assigned Gaius Fuficius Fango
1587	When the battle with Brutus and Cassius had been fought, Caesar and Antony redistributed the world, Caesar taking Numidia for his share of Libya, and Antony Africa.
1588	As he could not persuade Fango to give up the country, he associated himself with the natives, who detested their ruler; he
1588	narrative, had been elected even into the senate. had done evil in his office, for he was one of that mercenary force, many of whose members, as has been stated in my
1589	At this turn of affairs Fango retired into Numidia, where he accorded harsh treatment to the people of Cirta because they despised him on seeing his condition.
1590	Therefore he advised the king to subjugate Syria and the adjoining districts, while Caesar was detained in Italy and with Sextus, and Antony abandoned himself to love in Egypt.
1591	For this he himself punished the people of Alabanda when he had captured it, and razed to the ground Mylasa, abandoned by the dwellers there.
1592	There, after meeting his mother and wife, he made Caesar his enemy and cemented a friendship with Sextus.
1593	While he was thus engaged, Caesar, who had already arrived from Gaul, had collected his forces and had sent Publius Servilius Rullus to Brundusium, and Agrippa against Sipontum.
1594	The arrangement made allotted to Caesar Sardinia, Dalmatia, Spain and Gaul, and to Antony all the districts that belonged to the Romans across the Ionian Sea, both in Europe and in Asia.
1595	The government they divided anew in this way and the war against Sextus they made a common duty, although Antony through messengers had taken oaths before him against Caesar.
1596	And it was chiefly for this reason that Caesar had schooled himself to receive under a general amnesty all those who had gone
1596	over to the enemy in the war with Lucius, Antony's brother, some among them, Domitius particularly, who had been of the
1596	Cassius and later embraced the cause of Antony. assassins, as well as all those whose names had been posted on the tablets or had in any way coöperated with Brutus and
1597	When they had reached this agreement in the camp outside Brundusium, they entertained each other, Caesar in a soldierly, Roman fashion, and Antony with Asiatic and Egyptian manners.
1598	As it appeared that they had become reconciled, the soldiers who were at that time following Caesar surrounded Antony and demanded of him the money which they had promised them before the battle of Philippi.
1599	And when he failed to give them anything, they would certainly have done him some harm, if Caesar had not restrained them by feeding them with new hopes.
1600	For Sextus had come into Italy according to the agreement made between himself and Antony, intending with the latter's help to
1600	wage war against Caesar when he learned that they had settled their difficulties he himself went back into Sicily, but ordered
1600	of the other side. Menas, a freedman of his on whom he placed great reliance, to coast about with a portion of the fleet and damage the interests

1602	the "contributions," in addition, that were laid upon such as possessed slaves irritated them greatly. been cut off from importation of grain, while famine and the great number of taxes of all sorts that were being imposed and
1603	As much as they were pleased with the reconciliation of Antony and Caesar, for thought that harmony between these men meant peace for themselves, they were equally or more displeased at the war the two men were carrying on against Sextus.
1604	But a short time previously they had brought the two rulers into the city mounted on horses as if at a triumph, and had
1604	bestowed upon them the triumphal robe precisely similar to that worn by persons celebrating, had made them view the festivals
1604	Caesar, though she was then pregnant. from their chairs of state and had hastened to espouse to Antony, when once her husband was dead, Octavia the sister of
1605	At first forming in groups or gathering at some spectacle they urged Antony and Caesar to secure peace, crying out a great deal to this effect.
1606	When for some days it was not brought in, they took stones and drove the officials from the Forum, threw down the images of
1606	Caesar and Antony, and finally, on not accomplishing anything in this way even, rushed violently upon them as if to kill them.
1607	Caesar, although his followers were wounded, rent his clothes and betook himself to supplicating them, whereas Antony presented a less yielding front.
1608	Besides these events which took place that year Caesar gave a public funeral to his pedagogue Sphaerus, who had been freed by him.
1609	He had been so greatly advanced by Caesar that he was made consul without even being a member of the senate, and his brother who died before him had been laid to rest across the Tiber, a bridge being constructed for this very purpose.
1610	But nothing human is lasting, and he was finally accused in the senate by Caesar himself and executed as an enemy of his and
1610	triumvirs with the customary admonition, "that it should suffer no harm. of the entire people; thanksgivings were offered for his downfall and furthermore the care of the city was committed to the
1611	Naturally the day had to be subtracted again later, in order that the calendar should run according to the system devised by the former Caesar.
1612	These were the events of the two years; the next season, when Lucius Marcius and Gaius Sabinus held the consulship, the acts
1612	of the triumvirs from the time they had formed a close combination received ratification at the hands of the senate, and
1612	of the former Caesar. certain further taxes were imposed by them, because the expenditures proved far greater than had been allowed for in the time
1613	Then I might mention that Caesar now for the first time shaved his beard, and held a magnificent entertainment himself besides granting all the other citizens a festival at public expense.
1614	Hence, as the expenditures grew far greater than before, and the revenues were not anywhere sufficient but at this time came
1614	in in even smaller amounts by reason of the factional disputes, they introduced certain new taxes; and they enrolled in the
1614	senate as many persons as possible, not only from among the allies or soldiers, or sons of freedmen, but even slaves.
1615	Also the men first to enter upon office were accustomed to hold the title of the consulship through the entire year as is now
1615	done the rest were accorded the same title by the dwellers in the capital themselves and by the people in the rest of Italy
1615	therefore called them lesser consuls. during each period of their office as is also now the custom, but those in outside nations knew few or none of them and
1616	There was also present the entire fleet of Sextus and the entire infantry force of the other two; and not that merely, but the
1616	one command had been drawn up on the shore and the other on the ships, both fully armed, so that this very fact made it
1616	because of the people and Sextus because of his adherents. perfectly evident to all that it was from fear of their accoutrement and from necessity, that the two rulers were making peace
1617	It was recorded, at any rate, that all the rest save those mentioned should be allowed to return under a general amnesty and
1617	with a right to a quarter of their confiscated property; that tribuneships, praetorships and priesthoods should be given to
1617	some of them immediately; that Sextus himself should be chosen consul and be appointed augur, should obtain seventeen hundred
1617	and fifty myriads of denarii from his paternal estate, and should govern Sicily, Sardinia and Achaea for five years, not
1617	the sea for the peninsula, and sending a stated amount of grain to the people of the City. receiving deserters nor acquiring more ships nor keeping any garrisons in Italy, but bending his efforts to secure peace on
1618	After this the parties chiefly concerned as well as the rest received one another and inaugurated entertainments in turn, first Sextus on the ship and then Caesar and Antony on the shore.
1619	Nevertheless he did not act in any way as if he bore malice toward them, and on the following day he was feasted in turn and betrothed his daughter to Marcus Marcellus, the nephew of Caesar.
1620	The latter came upon Labienus before his presence was announced and terrified him by the suddenness of his approach and by his
1620	legions; for the Parthian leader was separated from the members of his tribe and had only soldiers from the neighborhood.
1621	Later he was captured by Demetrius, a freedman of the former Caesar, who had at this time been assigned to Cyprus by Antony.
1622	Ventidius himself received no reward for these achievements from the senate, since he was acting not with full powers, but as a lieutenant Antony, however, obtained praise and thanksgivings.
1623	He obtained a triumph in spite of the fact that Spain was assigned to Caesar; for the rulers could at will grant the honors to those who served as their lieutenants.
1624	It had been burned down and he built it up, adorning it splendidly at the dedication with various objects and with images, in particular, which he asked from Caesar, implying that he would send them back.
1625	Caesar shrank from seizure of sacred things and hence allowed them to remain as votive offerings.
1626	One who was chosen to be quaestor while still reckoned as a child then on the next day obtained the standing of a iuvenis and another person who had been enrolled in the senate desired to fight in the arena.
1627	He was prevented, however, from doing this, and an act was passed prohibiting any senator from taking part in gladiatorial
1627	city. combats, any slave from serving as lictor, and any burning of dead bodies from being carried on within fifteen stadia of the

1629	In obedience to the order the goddess went very far indeed out into the surges, where she remained an extremely long time and
1629	trees grew up round about her temple and in the Forum. returned only quite late, her action causing the Romans no little fear, so that they did not recover courage until four palm
1630	Besides these occurrences at the time Caesar married Livia.
1631	When Caesar accordingly hesitated and enquired of the pontifices whether it was permissible to wed her while pregnant, they
1631	nothing prevented an immediate consummation. answered that if the origin of the foetus were doubtful, the marriage should be put off, but if it were definitely admitted,
1632	One of the prattling boys, such as women frequently keep about them naked to play with, on seeing Livia reclining in one place
1632	pointing him out, "is reclining over there. with Caesar and Nero in another with some man, went up to her and said "What are you doing here, mistress? For your husband,"
1633	After these events, when the woman went to live with Caesar, she gave birth to Claudius Drusus Nero.
1634	Caesar took him and sent him to his father, making this entry in the records, that Caesar returned to its father Nero the child borne by Livia, his own wife.
1635	Nero died not long after and left Caesar himself as guardian to this boy and to Tiberius the populace had a good deal to say
1635	about this, among other things that the prosperous have children in three months; and this saying passed into a proverb.
1636	At just about the same time that this was going on in the city Bogud the Moor sailed to Spain, acting either on instructions
1636	from Antony or on his own motion, and did much damage, receiving also considerable injury in return meantime the people of his
1636	own land in the neighborhood of Tingi rose against him, and so he evacuated Spain but failed to win back his own domain.
1637	For the adherents of Caesar in Spain and Bocchus came to the aid of the rebels and proved too much for him.
1638	Bogud departed to join Antony, while Bocchus forthwith took possession of his kingdom, and this act was afterward confirmed by Caesar.
1639	At this time and even earlier Sextus and Caesar had broken out into war; for since they had come to an agreement not of their
1639	once and stood opposed. own free will or choice but under compulsion, they did not abide by it any time at all, so to speak, but broke the truce at
1640	Menas, who was at this time still in Sardinia, as if he were a kind of praetor, had incurred the suspicion of Sextus by his
1640	envied his position of power. release of Helenus and because he had been in communication with Caesar, and he was slandered to some extent by his peers, who
1641	He was therefore summoned by Sextus on the pretext that he should give an account of the grain and money of which he had
1641	surrendered to him the island, the fleet together with the army, and himself. charge; instead of obeying he seized and killed the men sent to him on this errand, and after negotiating with Caesar
1642	Caesar was glad to see him and declared that Sextus was harboring deserters contrary to the treaty, having triremes built, and
1642	of gold rings, and enrolled him in the order of the knights. keeping garrisons in Italy and so far from giving up Menas on demand, he supported him in great honor, gave him the decoration
1643	Sextus, having this as a reproach against Caesar, and the further facts that Achaea had been impoverished and the rights
1643	had him ravage Volturnum and other parts of Campania. agreed upon were not granted either to him or to the restored exiles, sent to Italy Menecrates, another freedman of his, and
1644	Caesar on learning this took the documents containing the treaty from the vestal virgins and sent for Antony and Lepidus.
1645	Antony came to Brundusium from Greece where, by chance, he still was but before he met Caesar, who was in Etruria, he became
1645	of the Parthian situation his excuse. alarmed because a wolf had entered his headquarters and killed soldiers; so he sailed back to Greece again, making the urgency
1646	Caesar, however much he felt that he had been abandoned by his colleague with the purpose that he should face the difficulties of the war alone, nevertheless showed no anger openly.
1647	In this several ships of Caesar were destroyed, because he was arrayed against expert seafarers; but Menecrates out of rivalry attacked Menas and perished, making the loss of Sextus an equal one.
1648	For this reason the latter laid no claim to victory and Caesar consoled himself over the defeat.
1649	He, discovering Caesar coasting along somewhere in these parts with the intention of crossing into Sicily along with Sabinus, made a dash upon him.
1650	Caesar had the ships come to anchor, marshaled the heavyarmed soldiers upon them, and at first made a noble resistance.
1651	When even then the pursuers pressed him hard, some of Caesar's ships suddenly cut their anchors and unexpectedly offered opposition.
1652	After this event an illfated wind on the following day fell upon Caesar and Sabinus as they were anchored together and made their previous reverse seem small.
1653	So it was that Caesar despaired of Sicily and was satisfied to guard the coast country Sextus on the other hand was still more

1655	Agrippa, he was consul with Lucius Gallus, would not hold the triumph, deeming it disgraceful for him to exalt himself when Caesar had fared poorly, but set to work heart and soul to fit out the fleet.
1656	The latter took root and grew, so that it amply supplied those who were afterward to celebrate triumphs; and Livia was destined to hold Caesar's power in a fold of her robe and to dominate him in everything.
1657	The senate was indignant at the utter devotion of the masses to him and took up his bones, on the plea that it was impious for
1657	other men there both before and after. them to lie in that consecrated spot; they were persuaded by the pontifices to make this declaration although they buried many

1663	Caesar, when his fleet had been made ready and spring set in, started from Baise and coasted along Italy, having great hopes of encompassing Sicily on all sides.
1664	With such calculations Caesar was hastening to Sicily.
1665	And had he not again changed sides on the promise of immunity and through some other hopes, besides betraying the whole fleet
1665	have proved fruitless. that he commanded by receiving some triremes that simulated desertion, Caesar's voyage to Sicily on this occasion also would
1666	Caesar was then extremely glad to receive him, but trusted him no longer.
1667	The one side surpassed in the number of its ships, the other in the experience of its sailors to the first the height of the
1667	vessels, the thickness of the catheads and the towers were a help, but charges straight ahead furthered the progress of the

1670	Some say that Agrippa because he was battling for Caesar and not for himself thought it sufficient merely to rout his adversaries.
1671	While the naval battle was in progress, Caesar, as soon as he perceived that Sextus was gone from Messana and that the strait
1671	to Tauromenium. was destitute of guards, did not let slip this opportunity of the war but immediately embarked on Antony's vessels and crossed
1672	When, however, the naval battle had ended, Sextus got back to Messana with speed, and learning of Caesar's presence he quickly filled the ships with fresh warriors and assailed him with the vessels and also with his heavyarmed men on land.
1673	Caesar did not come out to fight the latter, but sailed out against Sextus through contempt of the few opposing ships and
1673	himself. because they had been previously defeated then it was that he lost the majority of his fleet and barely avoided destruction
1674	Caesar in haste sent for Agrippa to render aid to them, and meantime they were being besieged.
1675	When, provisions began to fail them and no rescuing force appeared, Cornificius their leader became afraid that if he stayed
1675	where he was he should in the course of time be compelled by hunger to yield to the besieging party; and he reflected that
1675	while he delayed there in that way none of the enemy would come into conflict with him, because he was stronger in point of
1675	heavyarmed infantry, but if he should go forward in any direction one of two things would happen, either they would be
1675	place of safety, get a supply of provisions, and obtain some help from Caesar or from Agrippa. attacked by the enemy and come off victorious, or, if their adversaries were unwilling to do this, they would retire to a

1676	were in many places, and not as a rule favorably located. those died, and being struck from a distance with stones and javelins and receiving no blow from near at hand their wounds
1677	Caesar received them back with praises and gifts, although he had treated them after the victory of Agrippa in a very supercilious manner, thinking the latter had finished the war.
1678	Caesar after this entered Sicily and Sextus encamped opposite him in the vicinity of Artemisium.
1679	While they were stationed there in hostile array Sextus received as an accession Tisienus Gallus, and Caesar Lepidus with his forces.

1684	Their cries were directed to the combatants or were addressed by way of invocation to the gods; such as got the upper hand
1684	received praise and such as gave way abuse, and besides uttering many exhortations to their warriors they shouted not a little

1685	Caesar took up such of the vanquished as were cast on shore and went into the sea itself to set on fire all the vessels that
1685	ran aground in shoal water; thus there was no safety for such as continued to sail, for they would be disabled by Agrippa, nor

1686	In this hard position Demochares on the point of being taken slew himself and Apollophanes who had his ship unscathed and might have fled went over to Caesar.
1687	No one pursued him, for his sailing had been secret and Caesar was temporarily in the midst of great disturbance.
1688	When Caesar on ascertaining this came up quickly and withstood him, he was alarmed and slipped out of the city, but encamped
1688	on a strong hill and made complaints about his treatment; he detailed all the slights he had received and demanded all that
1688	subdue it. had been conceded to him according to their first compact and further laid claim to Sicily, on the ground that he had helped

1690	Caesar made no answer to it, thinking that he had justice all on his side and in his weapons, since he was stronger than his rival.
1691	In this way he too was compelled on his own initiative to array himself in mourning garments and become a suppliant of Caesar.
1692	Of those who had been enlisted in the cause of Sextus, members of the senatorial or equestrian classes were punished, save a
1692	few, while in the case of the rank and file all free citizens were incorporated in the legions of Caesar, and those that had
1692	impaled. been slaves were given back to their masters for vengeance in case no master could be found for any one of them, he was
1693	While Caesar was thus occupied his soldiers revolted.
1694	When their talk had no effect, for Caesar since no enemy longer confronted him made light of them, they became clamorous.
1695	This was not because they really wished to be free from it, for most of them were in their prime, but because they had an inkling of the coming conflict between Caesar and Antony and for that reason set a high value upon themselves.
1696	Caesar would not yield to them, even if he knew for an absolute certainty that the war was going to occur and clearly understood their wishes.
1697	In this way Caesar calmed the soldiers temporarily.
1698	The people of the capital unanimously bestowed laudations upon him and images, the right to front seats and an arch surmounted
1698	by a trophy, as well as the privilege of riding into the city on horseback, of wearing the laurel crown on all occasions, and
1698	he had conquered, which was to be a perpetual day of thanksgiving. of holding a banquet with his wife and children in the precinct of the Capitoline Jupiter on the anniversary of the day that
1699	The persons to announce it were, first, a soldier stationed in the city, who on the very day in question had become possessed

1700	Others said that since he was unable in any way to collect the debts he made of the people's impotency a favor that cost him nothing.
1701	These were the gifts bestowed upon Caesar by the senate.

1709	Since Caesar at that time was still getting the worst of it against Sextus, the truth of the facts could not be rendered fitting or opportune.
1710	Caesar meantime, since Sextus had perished and affairs in Libya required settlement, went to Sicily as if intending to take ship thither, but after delaying there found that the winter made it too late for crossing.
1711	In this way they learned both their own weakness and Caesar's force of mind, and so they really experienced a change of heart and after urgent supplications were allowed to enter the service anew.
1712	For Caesar, being in need of soldiers and fearing that Antony would appropriate them, said that he pardoned them, and he found them most useful for all tasks.
1713	Then by night they destroyed all of these and set fire to their houses, some killing themselves and some their wives and children in addition, so that nothing whatever remained for Caesar.
1714	It was against this people, then, that Caesar at that time conducted a campaign.
1715	Caesar secured boats made by the allies in that vicinity, and after towing them through the Ister into the Savus, and through
1715	that stream into the Colops, he assailed the enemy with infantry and ships together, and had some naval battles on the river.

1722	Not only did he say this in Alexandria, but sent a despatch to Rome, in order that it might secure ratification also from the people there.
1723	Domitius and Sosius were consuls by that time and being extremely devoted to him refused to accede to Caesar's urgent demands that they should publish it to all.
1724	Though they prevailed in this matter Caesar won a victory in turn by not having anything that had been written about the Armenian king made known to the public.
1725	While Antony was engaged as described he dared to write to the senate that he wished to give up his office and put all affairs
1725	into the hands of that body and of the people he was not really intending to do anything of the kind, but he desired that

1730	And another praetor died on the last day of his term, whereupon Caesar chose another for the remaining hours.
1731	They made a covenant to serve each other as allies, the one against the Parthians and the other against Caesar, and to cement
1731	the compact they exchanged some soldiers; the Median prince received a portion of the newly acquired Armenia and Antony his

1737	Caesar's charge against him was that he was holding Egypt and other countries that he had not drawn by lot, had killed Sextus

1743	Caesar on learning this declared, to prevent its appearing that he had been abandoned by them as a result of some injustice,
1743	that he had sent them out voluntarily and that he granted the rest who so wished permission to depart unarmed to Antony.
1744	This action of theirs just mentioned was counterbalanced by the arrival of others who had fled from Antony to Caesar among them Titius and Plancus, though they were honored by Antony among the foremost and knew all his secrets.
1745	Their desertion was due to some friction between themselves and the Roman leader, or perhaps they were disgusted in the matter
1745	of Cleopatra at any rate they left soon after the consuls had taken the final step and Caesar in the latter's absence had

1746	Caesar was very glad to receive the pair and learned from them about Antony's condition, what he was doing, what he had in mind, what was written in his will, and the name of the man that had it; for they had taken part in sealing it.
1747	He became still more violently enraged from this cause and did not shrink from searching for the document, seizing it, and then carrying it into the senate and subsequently the assembly, and reading it.
1748	The writer had asseverated the fact that Caesarion was truly sprung from Caesar, had given some enormous presents to his

1754	As a result Caesar kept the more vigilant watch and gave money to his soldiers.
1755	Such was the vigor and the equipment of the two; and meantime all sorts of stories were circulated by men, and from the gods also there were many plain indications.
1756	The chariot of Jupiter was demolished in the Roman hippodrome, and for many days a flash would rise over the sea toward Greece and dart up into the firmament.
1757	Antony was given omens of defeat beforehand by the children in Rome; without any one's having suggested it they formed two

1758	His death was portended by what happened to one of his images set up as an offering in the temple of Jupiter at Albanum; although it was stone it sent forth streams of blood.
1759	Caesar was busied settling matters in Italy, especially when he discovered the presence of money sent by Antony, and so could not go to the front before winter.
1760	His rival started out with the intention of carrying the war into Italy before they suspected his movements, but when he came
1760	to Corcyra and ascertained that the advance guard of ships sent to reconnoitre his position was hiding in the vicinity of the

1761	Meanwhile volunteers from each party went over to both sides, senators as well as others, and Lucius Messius was caught as a spy by Caesar.

1765	About this time a madman rushed into the theatre at one of the festivals, seized the crown of the former Caesar and put it on, whereupon he was torn to pieces by the bystanders.
1766	Disregarding such omens as had appeared to them they neither felt fear nor displayed less hostility but spent the winter in employing spies and annoying each other.
1767	Caesar had set sail from Brundusium and proceeded as far as Corcyra, intending to attack the ships near Actium while off their guard, but he encountered rough weather and received damage which caused him to withdraw.
1768	Caesar in turn was encouraged by this and wished to employ as soon as possible the energy of the army, which was trained to a fine point, and to carry on the war in Greece near his rival's supporters rather than in Italy near Rome.
1769	Actium is a place sacred to Apollo and is located in front of the mouth of the narrows leading into the Ambracian Gulf opposite the harbors at Nicopolis.
1770	As soon as Antony ascertained Caesar's arrival, he did not delay, but hastened to Actium with his followers.
1771	He reached there in a short time but did not at once risk an encounter, though Caesar was constantly marshaling his infantry

1772	For this very reason the latter was unwilling to risk his all, and he had recourse for several days to trials and skirmishes until he had gathered his legions.
1773	With these, especially since Caesar no longer displayed an equal readiness to assail them, he crossed the narrows and encamped not far from him, after which he sent cavalry around the gulf and besieged him on both sides.
1774	Caesar himself remained quiet, and did not take any risks which he could avoid, but sent a detachment into Greece and Macedonia with the intention of drawing Antony off in that direction.

1780	If, again, any one makes much of their good fortune in that combat, he is bound to take into equal consideration the defeat which Caesar himself suffered at the hands of Sextus.
1781	And, in general, how large a part does Sicily form of the whole empire and how large a fraction of our equipment did the
1781	troops of Sextus possess, that any one should properly fear Caesar's armament, which is precisely the same as before and has
1781	grown neither larger nor better, just on account of his good luck, instead of taking courage from the defeat that he endured?
1781	Reflecting on this fact I have not cared to risk our first engagement with the infantry, where they appear to have strength in

1782	this, seeing that they have removed Lepidus, who was guilty of no wrong and was further their ally, from all his powers as

1784	received it, open it, and read it publicly? And how will he manifest any humanity to others with whom he has no connection,
1784	when he has shown himself such a man toward me, his friend, his table companion, his relative?"Now in case we are to draw any
1784	inferences from his decrees, he threatens you openly, having made the majority of you enemies outright, but against me

1786	And since the defeat of Sextus had been largely due to the size of Caesar's ships and the number of his marines, Antony had
1786	equipped his vessels to surpass greatly those of his opponents, for he had had constructed only a few triremes, but the rest

1803	Caesar now proceeded to teach the cities a lesson by levying money and taking away the remnant of authority over their citizens that they possessed in their assemblies.
1804	The people of Cydonea and Lampea he set free, because they had rendered him some assistance, and he helped the Lampeans found anew their city, from which they had been uprooted.

1806	The latter met death because he was a son of the former Curio who had once been of great assistance to the former Caesar.
1807	The mass of Antony's soldiers was included in the ranks of Caesar's legions and later he sent back to Italy the citizens over age of both forces, without giving any of them anything, and the remainder he disbanded.
1808	The men, however, who had helped Caesar to gain the victory and had been dismissed from the service, were irritated at having obtained no meed of valor, and not much later they began a revolutionary movement.
1809	Caesar was suspicious of them, and fearing that they might despise Maecenas, to whom at that time Rome and the remainder of Italy had been entrusted, because he was a knight, he sent Agrippa to Italy as if on some routine business.
1810	He also gave to Agrippa and to Maecenas so great authority over everything that they might read beforehand the letters which he often wrote to the senate and to various officials, and then change whatever they wished in them.

1822	These were practicing in Cyzicus for the triumphal games which they were expecting to hold in honor of Caesar's overthrow, and
1822	as soon as they were made aware of what had taken place, they set out for Egypt with the intention of aiding their superiors.
1823	They sent for Antony, feeling that they could fight with him better in Syria then, when he neither came himself nor sent them
1823	in a gladiatorial show. any message, they decided that he had perished, and reluctantly made terms with the condition that they should never take part
1824	They received from Didius Daphne, the suburb of Antioch, to dwell in, until the matter was called to Caesar's attention.
1825	Then they were tricked somewhat later by Messala and were sent in different directions under the pretext that they were to be enlisted in different legions and were in some convenient way destroyed.
1826	When Antony and Cleopatra heard from the envoys the commands which Caesar issued regarding them, they sent to him again.
1827	Finally he surrendered to him Publius Turullius, a senator, who had been an assassin of Caesar, but was then living with him as a friend.
1828	Caesar put Turullius to death; it happened that this man had cut wood for the fleet from the forest of Asclepius in Cos, and by his punishment in the same place he was thought to have paid the penalty to the god.
1829	But to Antony Caesar did not even then answer a word.
1830	Hence, though he wished to set out and follow the summons of the gladiators, he did not go into Syria.
1831	The next event was that Caesar took Pelusium, pretendedly by storm, but really betrayed by Cleopatra.
1832	She saw that no one came to her aid and perceived that Caesar was not to be withstood; most important of all, she heard the message sent to her by Thyrsus, and believed that she was really the object of affection.
1833	At the news about Pelusium Antony returned from Paraetonium and in front of Alexandria met Caesar, who was exhausted from travel; he joined battle with him, therefore, with his cavalry and was victorious.
1834	Caesar himself voluntarily read the pamphlets to his soldiers, reproaching Antony the while, and led them to feel ashamed of treachery and to acquire enthusiasm in his behalf.
1835	Cleopatra seeing this caused the ships to desert and she herself rushed suddenly into the mausoleum pretending that she feared
1835	Caesar and desired by some means to destroy herself before capture, but really as an invitation to Antony to enter there also.
1836	She now began to feel confidence in Caesar and immediately made him aware of what had taken place, but did not feel altogether confident that she would experience no harm.
1837	Caesar was anxious to make himself master of her treasures, to seize her alive, and to take her back for his triumph.
1838	When she expressed a desire to appear before Caesar and converse with him, it was granted; and to beguile her still more, he promised that he would come to her himself.
1839	When, after this, Caesar entered, she hastily arose, blushing, and said "Hail, master, Heaven has given joy to you and taken it from me.
1840	She kept turning her eyes toward Caesar, and melodiously continued to bewail her fate.
1841	She spoke in melting tones, saying at one time, "Of what avail, Caesar, are these your letters? ," and at another, "But in the man before me you also are alive for me.
1842	Caesar comprehended her outbreak of passion and appeal for sympathy.
1843	She was distressed that he would neither look at her nor breathe a word about the kingdom or any sigh of love, and fell at his knees wailing "Life for me, Caesar, is neither desirable nor possible.
1844	Would that I had perished on the very instant after Caesar's death! But since this present fate was my destiny, send me to Antony grudge me not burial with him, that as I die because of him, so in Hades also I may dwell with him.
1845	Such words she uttered expecting to obtain commiseration Caesar, however, made no answer to it.
1846	Suspecting this, and regarding it as worse than innumerable deaths, she began to desire really to die and begged Caesar frequently that she might be allowed to perish in some way, and devised many plans by herself.
1847	First she gave a sealed paper, in which she begged Caesar to order that she be buried beside Antony, to Epaphroditus himself to deliver, pretending that it contained some other matter.
1848	Caesar on hearing of her demise was shocked, and both viewed her body and applied drugs to it and sent for Psylli, in the hope that she might possibly revive.
1849	But Caesar, when he could not in any way resuscitate Cleopatra, felt admiration and pity for her and was himself excessively grieved, as much as if he had been deprived of all the glory of the victory.
1850	Of their children Antyllus was slain immediately, though he was betrothed to the daughter of Caesar, and had taken refuge in his father's heroshrine which Cleopatra had built.
1851	Caesarion was fleeing to Ethiopia, but was overtaken on the road and murdered.
1852	To this man, who had been brought up in Italy and had been with him on campaigns, Caesar gave the maid and her ancestral kingdom, and he granted them the lives of Alexander and Ptolemy.
1853	The Egyptians and Alexandrians were all spared, and Caesar did not injure one of them.
1854	He nevertheless offered the pretext that he wished to please their god Serapis, Alexander their founder, and, third, Areus a citizen, who was a philosopher and enjoyed his society.
1855	For the same reason he would not enter the presence of Apis, declaring that he was "accustomed to worship gods and not cattle.
1856	And of the system then imposed upon them most details are rigorously preserved to the present day, but there are senators in
1856	senate in the reign of his son Antoninus. Alexandria, beginning first under the emperor Severus, and they also may serve in Rome, having first been enrolled in the
1857	Out of this all the soldiers got what was still owing to them, and those who were with Caesar at that time secured in addition two hundred and fifty denarii apiece for not plundering the city.
1858	After attending to the matters before mentioned Caesar founded there also on the site of the battle a city and gave to it likewise a name and dedicatory games, as in the previous instance.
1859	There had been disputes among them and a certain Tiridates had risen against Phraates; as long as Antony's opposition lasted,
1859	made no other answer than that he would think it over. even after the naval battle, Caesar had not only not attached himself to either side, though they sought his alliance, but
1860	They granted Caesar a triumph over Cleopatra and granted him an arch bearing a trophy at Brundusium, and another one in the Roman Forum.
1861	There should be a thanksgiving on his birthday and on the anniversary of the announcement of the victory when he entered the city the vestal virgin priestesses, the senate and the people, with their wives and children, were to meet him.
1862	Then they voted to Caesar additional crowns and many thanksgivings, and granted him among other rights authority to conduct a triumph over the Egyptians also.
1863	Also Caesar was to hold the tribunician power for life, to have the right to defend such as called upon him for help both

1864	In the prayers in behalf of the people and the senate petitions should be offered for him alike by the priests and by the priestesses.
1865	And when the letter came regarding the Parthians, they decreed that he should have a place in hymns along with the gods, that
1865	a tribe should be named "Julian" after him, that he should wear the triumphal crown during the progress of all the festivals,
1865	that the senators who had participated in his victory should take part in the procession wearing purplebordered togas, and
1865	sacred. that the day on which he should enter the city should be glorified by sacrifices by the entire population and be held ever
1866	Caesar accepted most of the honors save only a few but that all the population of the city should meet him he particularly requested might not occur.
1867	Caesar meanwhile was giving his attention to various business, and granted permission that precincts dedicated to Rome and to Caesar his father, calling him "the Julian hero," should be set apart in Ephesus and in Nicaea.
1868	Still, even there, after their death, honors as to gods are bestowed upon those who have ruled uprightly, and heroshrines are built.
1869	In the course of the summer Caesar crossed over to Greece and on to Italy.
1870	Caesar was consul all the year, as the two previous, but Potitus was the successor of Sextus.
1871	It was he who publicly and in person sacrificed oxen in behalf of the senate and of the people at Caesar's arrival, something that had never before been done in the case of any single man.
1872	Among the many marks of favor by which Caesar distinguished Agrippa was the dark blue symbol of naval supremacy.
1873	To his soldiers also he made certain presents to the people he distributed a hundred denarii each, first to those ranking as adults, and afterward to the children as a mark of his affection for his nephew Marcellus.
1874	Caesar also held one since the credit of this victory properly pertained to his position as imperator.
1875	Behind them all Caesar came driving and did everything according to custom except that he allowed his fellowconsul and the other magistrates, contrary to custom, to follow him with the senators who had participated in the victory.
1876	After completing this, he dedicated the temple of Minerva, called also the Chalcidicum, and the Julian senatehouse, which had been built in honor of his father.
1877	It belonged to the Tarentini, and had been brought from there to Rome, where it was placed in the senatechamber and decked with the spoils of Egypt.
1878	Many of them were placed as offerings in it and others were dedicated to Capitoline Jupiter and Juno and Minerva, while all
1878	defiled. the votive gifts that were thought to have previously reposed there or were still reposing were now by decree taken down as
1879	A certain Quintus Vitellius, a senator, fought as a gladiator.
1880	Now these Dacians had before this time sent envoys to Caesar but when they obtained none of their requests, they turned away to follow Antony.
1881	There was no intermission in spite of a sickness of Caesar's, but it was carried on in his absence, under the direction of others.
1882	While Caesar was yet in his fourth consulship Statilius Taurus had both constructed at his own expense and dedicated with armed combat a huntingtheatre of stone on the Campus Martius.
1883	On this account he was permitted by the people to choose one of the praetors year after year.
1884	The armor stripped from the prince he would have dedicated as spolia opima to Jupiter Feretrius, had he been a general acting on his own authority.
1885	Roles when he visited Caesar was treated as a friend and ally for this assistance the captives were distributed to the soldiers.
1886	For sacrifices and a triumph had been voted not only to Caesar but to him also, though, according at least to some accounts, he did not secure the title of imperator, but Caesar alone might apply it to himself.
1887	Also he granted them the piece of land in which they magnify the god, and took it away from the Bessi, who were occupying it.
1888	The natives in great numbers had occupied this place, which is extremely large and so very strong that the tradition obtains that the Titans after the defeat administered to them by the gods took refuge there.
1889	Here the people had brought together all their flocks and their other principal valuables.
1890	After this they reverted to nothing more nor less than a state of monarchy again, although Cæsar had a plan to lay down his arms and entrust affairs to the senate and the populace.
1891	Otherwise we shall seem to have been unable to bear good fortune and to have gone mad through our successes, or else to have
1891	the senate" forward as an excuse. been aiming at it long since, to have used our father and our devotion to him as a mere screen, to have put "the people and

1893	Consequently the majority of the people have an eye only to their own interests and hate all other citizens they esteem their neighbor's good fortune as a personal loss, and his misfortunes as a personal gain.
1894	So liberal a citizen would immediately acquire a reputation for patriotism among the mass of the people, would become conceited, and cause a disturbance in politics.
1895	Now if you hand over the legions and the offices to such men, there will be danger that both you and your government will be overthrown.
1896	As long as the people had the monarchical government, they effected nothing of importance but when they began to live under the democratic system, they became most renowned.
1897	Yet, why need we use foreign examples, when we have some of our own? We Romans, ourselves, after trying a different social
1897	organization at first, later, when we had gone through many bitter experiences, felt a desire for liberty; and having secured
1897	debated, the people ratified, the force under arms showed zeal, and the commanders were fired with ambition. it we attained our present eminence, strong in no advantages save those that come from democracy, through which the senate

1901	Marius, Sulla, Metellus, and Pompey at first, when they got control of affairs, refused to become princes, and by this attitude escaped harm.
1902	Cinna, however, and Strabo, the second Marius, Sertorius, and Pompey himself at a later date, through their desire for sovereignty perished miserably.
1903	You have heard that the people banished Camillus when he used white horses for his triumph you have heard that they overthrew
1903	some suspicion that he wanted monarchy. Scipio after condemning him for some fraudulent procedure you remember how they behaved toward your father because they had
1904	The boasted "freedom" of the mob proves to be the most bitter servitude of the best element and brings a common destruction upon both.
1905	Do not think that I am advising you to enslave the people and the senate and then play the tyrant.
1906	But since the gods have taken pity on this land and have set you up as her arbiter and chief; do not betray your country.
1907	That I do right to urge you to be sole ruler of the people I think you have long ere this been persuaded.

1909	There is evidence of this in the case of Pompey, who, when he withdrew from his supremacy, became the victim of scorn and of plots he found himself unable to win back his place, and so perished.
1910	For if they had not murdered him in so unjust and pitiable a fashion, you would not have taken up arms, would not have

1912	the populace, for they will surely quarrel, nor in charge of the senate, for its members will contend for the prize.
1913	But if two citizen legions are wintering in the same province and more than this number I should not advise you to trust to

1915	The disposition of the funds, also, of both the people and the empire, I mean, whether in Rome or in the rest of Italy or outside, should be entirely in the hands of the knights.
1916	If any one of the knights after passing through many forms of service distinguishes himself enough to become a senator, his age ought not to hinder him at all from being enrolled in the senate.
1917	Let some of those even be registered who have held the post of company leaders in citizen forces, unless it be one who has

1920	introduce before the senate the embassies which come from the enemy and from those under truce, both kings and peoples.
1921	For it is aweinspiring and impressive to let the senate appear to be master of all situations and to exhibit many adversaries prepared for petitioners who are guilty of double dealing.
1922	Next, have all the laws enacted by the senators, and do not impose a single one upon all the people alike, except the decrees of that body.
1923	Thirdly, it would be well in case the senators who are serving in the city, their children or their wives, are ever charged
1923	with any serious crime, so that a person convicted would receive a penalty of disenfranchisement or exile or even death, that

1932	After this he entered upon a censorship with Agrippa and besides setting aright some other business he investigated the senate.
1933	Many knights and many footsoldiers, too, who did not deserve it were in the senate as a result of the civil wars, so that the total of that body amounted to a thousand.
1934	He added to the class of patricians, the senate allowing him to do this because most of its members had perished.
1935	In addition to the above measures he forbade all persons in the senate to go outside of Italy, unless he himself should order or permit any one of them to do so.
1936	Cæsar brought him before the senate, where he was condemned and the sentence of death imposed.

1942	He was declared to be equal to a god and obtained eternal honors, whereas those who slew him perished, the evil men, in evil plight.
1943	In this way he had his headship ratified by the senate and the people.
1944	The weaker ones, because as he said they were peaceful and free from war, he gave over to the senate.
1945	His pretext was that the senate should fearlessly gather the fruits of the finest portion of the empire, while he himself had
1945	alone had arms and kept soldiers. the labors and dangers his real purpose was that by this plan the senators be unarmed and unprepared for battle, while he

1947	Later he gave Cyprus and Gaul adjacent to Narbo back to the people, and he himself took Dalmatia instead.
1948	In the course of this time he promised to reduce them to quiet and he carried his playfulness to the point of saying that if they should be sooner pacified, he would deliver them sooner to the senate.
1949	They were to be sent out by the assembly of the senate as a body, with no sword at their side nor wearing the military garb.
1950	In the case of the senate he privately gave Africa and Asia to the exconsuls and all the other districts to the exprætors.
1951	Some who have not this authority are sent out to the provinces called "provinces of the senate and the people", namely, such quæstors as the lot may designate and men who are coassessors with those who hold the actual authority.
1952	This is the method followed in regard to the provinces of the people.

1956	When he had really completed the details of administration, the name Augustus was finally applied to him by the senate and by the people.
1957	All most precious and sacred objects are termed augusta.
1958	In this way all the power of the people and that of the senate reverted to Augustus, and from his time there was a genuine monarchy.
1959	These particular names they have never assumed since the terms first fell out of use in the Senate, but they are confirmed in the prerogatives of these positions by the appellation of imperator.
1960	By virtue of being consecrated in all the priesthoods and furthermore having the right to give the majority of them to others
1960	they are themselves also masters of holy and sacred things. and from the fact that one of the high priests if there be two or three holding office at once is chosen from their number,
1961	It was doubtless absolutely impossible for the people to be preserved under a democracy.
1962	Formerly everything was referred to the senate and the people even if it occurred at a distance; hence all learned of it and many recorded it.
1963	In the open senate he consecrated himself to him after the fashion of the Spaniards and advised the rest to do the same.
1964	Pacuvius ordered all to offer sacrifice for this occurrence and before the people he once said he should make Augustus his inheritor on equal terms with his son.
1965	Some features he brought before the entire senate.
1966	The entire senate by itself sat in judgment as formerly and transacted business with occasional groups of envoys and heralds from both peoples and kings.
1967	Furthermore the people and the plebs came together for the elections, but nothing was done that would not please Cæsar.
1968	Some of those who were to hold office he himself chose out and nominated and others he put, according to ancient custom, in
1968	by bribery. the power of the people and the plebs, yet taking care that no unfit persons should be appointed, nor by factious cliques nor
1969	Why should any one list such things as either expenditures or donations, when the people and the emperor are constantly making both the one and the other in common?  These were the acts of Augustus at that time.
1970	He made a census of the people and set in order their life and government.
1971	The builder incurred no jealousy for it but was greatly honored both by Augustus himself and by all the rest of the people.
1972	The senate unanimously voted that he should be convicted in the courts, be deprived of his property, and be exiled, that his possessions be given to Augustus, and that they should sacrifice oxen.
1973	In return he received from the people the expenses incurred in his position and by a suspension of the law was made prætor.
1974	For those who were still of the military age he arranged some spectacles right among the legions, through the agency of Tiberius and Marcellus as ædiles.
1975	It has this name perhaps because it received the images of many gods and among them the statues of Mars and Venus; but my own opinion is that the name is due to its round shape, like the sky.
1976	Augustus now entered upon office for the tenth time with Gaius Norbanus, and on the first day of the month the senate took oaths, confirming his deeds.
1977	When he was announced as drawing near the city his sickness had delayed him, he promised to give the people a hundred denarii

1979	After being restored to health on this occasion he brought his will into the senate and wished to read it, by way of showing people that he had left no successor to his position.
1980	But his final attitude seemed to show that he was not yet confident of the youth's judgment and that he either wanted the people to get back their liberty or Agrippa to receive the leadership from them.
1981	He understood well that Agrippa and the people were on the best of terms and he was unwilling to appear to be delivering the supreme power with his own hands.
1982	The senate consequently voted that Augustus be tribune for life and that he might bring forward at each meeting of the senate
1982	any business he liked concerning any one matter, even if he should not be consul at the time, and allowed him to hold the
1982	again outside. office of proconsul once for all perpetually, so that he had neither to lay it down on entering the pomerium nor to take it up
1983	For, when Tiridates in person and envoys from Phraates arrived to settle their mutual disputes, he introduced them to the senate.
1984	They accordingly wished to elect him as dictator, and shutting the senate up within its halls they forced it to vote this measure by threatening to burn down the building.
1985	Next they took the twentyfour rods and accosted Augustus, begging him both to be named dictator and to become commissioner of grain, as Pompey had once been.

1987	For this he received praise from sensible persons and was even given the right to convene the senate as often as he pleased.
1988	It was at this period that he restored both Cyprus and Gallia Narbonensis to the people as provinces no longer needing his administration of martial law.
1989	He also dedicated the temple of Jupiter Tonans, concerning which event these two traditions survive, that at the time thunder occurred during the ritual, and that later Augustus had a dream, which I shall proceed to describe.
1990	He thought that the throng had come to do reverence to the deity, partly attracted by the novelty of his name and form and

1993	The people of Cyzicus he reduced to slavery because during an uprising they had flogged and put to death some Romans.
1994	And when he reached Syria he took the same action in the case of the people of Tyre and Sidon on account of their uprising.
1995	Indeed, in honor of his success he both commanded sacrifices to be voted and performed them, besides constructing a temple of Mars Ultor on the Capitol, in imitation of Jupiter Feretrius, for the offering up of the standards.

2000	The breastplate which he often wore beneath his dress even on entering the senate itself he expected would be of small and slight assistance to him in that case.
2001	It had been his plan to make them three hundred as in old times, and he thought he ought to be well satisfied if he found so many of them worthy of the senate.
2002	A certain Licinius Regulus after this, indignant because his name had been erased whereas his son and several others to whom

2005	Much of what a sovereign does by way of punishment either personally or through the senate on the ground that plots have been

2010	After the consecration of this edifice he arranged through Tiberius and Drusus for gladiatorial combats, permission having been granted them by the senate.

2016	Nay, he did not so much as write the senate anything about what had been accomplished.
2017	The senate convened and among other decisions resolved to place an altar in the senatechamber itself, to commemorate the
2017	return of Augustus, and that criminals who approached him as suppliants within the pomerium should be exempt from punishment.
2018	However, he accepted neither of these honors and even escaped a reception by the people on this occasion by being brought into the city under the cover of night.
2019	The following day he greeted the people on the Palatine, ascended the Capitol, and taking off the laurel from around his rods he placed it upon the knees of Jupiter.
2020	For that day he furnished the people with baths and barbers free of charge.
2021	After this he convened the senate and made no address himself by reason of hoarseness, but gave the book to the quaestor to
2021	read which enumerated his achievements and promulgated rules as to how many years the citizens should serve in the army and
2021	how much money they should receive at the end of their services in place of the land for which they were always wont to ask.
2022	Iullus, the son of Antony, who was prætor, celebrated the birthday of Augustus with horseraces and slaughterlng of wild beasts, and entertained both him and the senate following a decree of that body upon the Capitol.
2023	After this there was another reorganization of the senate.
2024	Hence none of them was any longed enrolled in the senate without having secured some one of the other offices that lead to it.
2025	The senate had voted during the absence of Augustus another measure besides this, namely that, since nobody could any longer

2026	Indeed, he rebuked Tiberius because he had seated Gaius beside him at the thanksgiving festival which he gave in honor of the emperor's return and he censured the people for honoring him with applause and eulogies.
2027	On the death of Lepidus he was appointed high priest and the senate consequently wished to vote him certain honors; but he declared that he would not accept them, and when the senators became urgent he rose and left the gathering.
2028	Cornelius Sisenna was blamed for the conduct of his wife and stated in the senate that he had married her with the knowledge and on the advice of the emperor, whereat Augustus grew exceedingly angry.
2029	He indulged in no violence of word or action but hurried out of the senatechamber and then a little later came back again,
2029	and be compelled to do some harm. choosing rather to do this as he said to his friends afterward, in spite of its not being right, than to remain where he was
2030	He helped his friend organize the monarchy like one who was really in love with the idea of supreme power and he won over the populace by his kindness, showing himself most truly a friend of the people.
2031	The latter not only rendered these public property, but distributed to the people also a hundred denarii apiece, with the explanation that Agrippa had ordered it.
2032	However, he did not allow any of the citizens to omit any of the ancestral customs although none of the more prominent men wished to present himself for the festivals and he personally superintended the gladiatorial combats.
2033	After this Augustus was chosen supervisor and corrector of morals for another five years, this also he received for a limited
2033	period as he had the monarchy, and he ordered the senators to burn incense as often as they had a sitting, and not to come to

2035	For these achievements the senate voted him a triumph, but Augustus did not allow him to hold it, granting him instead the triumphal honors.
2036	While these events were occurring Augustus took a census, reckoning in all the property that belonged to him, as an individual might do, and also making a list of the senate.
2037	The senate and the people again contributed money to be spent on images of himself, but he would erect no such likeness, and only set up representations of the Public Health, of Concord, and of Peace.
2038	I have also heard the story that on one day of the year, following some oracle or dream, he would assume the guise of a beggar and would accept money from those who passed.
2039	At this same time the first priest of Jupiter sinceMerula was appointed; and the quaestors were ordered to pay careful heed to

2043	Many buildings were destroyed by storm and thunderbolts, among them many temples even that of Jupiter Capitolinus and the temple annexed to it were injured.
2044	Tiberius, while Drusus was still alive, had overcome the Dalmatians and Pannonians, who were again a little restless, had
2044	celebrated a triumph on horseback, and had banqueted the people, a part on the Capitol and a part in many other places.
2045	For upon such men or women as are not granted so many offspring by Heaven, or at least upon some of them, a law emanating formerly from the senate but now from the emperor bestows the dignities belonging to parents of three children.
2046	Not only men but gods enjoy the privilege, to the end that, if any one dying leaves them anything, they may take possession of it.
2047	Augustus ordered that the sittings of the senate should be held on specified days.
2048	For the latter were indignant that they might bring no proposition before the senate although they ranked above the tribunes
2048	in dignity and they received from Augustus the right of doing so, but in the course of time it was taken away from them again.
2049	These and other laws which he at this time enacted he inscribed on white tablets and submitted to the senate before taking any

2051	But the next year, in which Asinius Gallus and Graius Marcius were consuls, he came back and carried the laurel, contrary to custom, into the temple of Jupiter Feretrius.
2052	The people generally wanted September to be so named, because he had been born in it, but he preferred the other month, in which he had first been appointed consul and had conquered in many great battles.
2053	This also is a very great proof of Mæcenas's excellence, that he made himself liked by Augustus, in spite of resisting his projects, and pleased all the people.
2054	Tiberius on the first day that he began the consulship with Gnæus Piso convened the senate in the Octavium, because it was outside the pomerium.
2055	He himself entertained the senate on the Capitol, and she the women privately.

2058	After that he gave Gaius a priesthood, with the right of attendance in the senate and of beholding spectacles and sitting at banquets with that body.
2059	The result was that he was soon at odds with the people and Tiberius, though without effecting anything.
2060	The people felt that they had been slighted, and Tiberius feared their anger.

2064	To Augustus himself a sacred contest was offered in Neapolis, the Campanian city, nominally because he had helped it rise when
2064	it was prostrated by earthquake and by fire, but in reality because the inhabitants, alone of their neighbors, were

2065	In this instance when he learned what was going on, he gave way to such violent rage that he could not keep the matter to himself, but communicated it to the senate.
2066	Gaius' captaincy of the legions on the Ister was a peaceful period.
2067	Soon after the latter died, and his son Artabazus received it as the gift of Augustus and the senate.
2068	Augustus, in the depth of grief, communicated his desire to the senate, and urged him to come at any rate to Italy and then do what he pleased.
2069	He, too, was being given practice in many places, sent now here, now there; and he was wont to read personally the letters of Gaius before the senate, so often as he was present.
2070	The targes and the golden spears which they had received from the knights on entering the class of iuvenes were set up in the senatehouse.
2071	Augustus was once called "master" by the people, but he not only forbade that any one should use this form of address to him but took very good care in every way to enforce his command.
2072	When Augustus had restored his dwelling he made all of it public property, either because of the contributions made by the people or because he was high priest and wished to live in a building both private and public.
2073	The people urged Augustus very strongly to rescind the sentence of exile passed upon his daughter, but he answered that fire would mix with water before she should be brought back.
2074	After this he took courage, and feeling that he had successors and supporters, he became desirous to organize the senate once more.
2075	While he was thus occupied plots were formed against him, and notably one by Gnæus Cornelius, a son of the daughter of Pompey the Great.
2076	We should be peers of the gods if we did not have troubles and cares and fears beyond all private individuals.

2079	At this time, in the consulship of Cornelius and Valerius Messala, earthquakes of ill omen occurred and the Tiber tore away the bridge so that the City was under water for seven days.
2080	Many contended for the honor, and so they drew lots in the senate in the presence of their fathers; no priestess, however, was appointed from this class.
2081	Twentythree legions were being supported at that time, or, as others say, twentyfive, of citizen soldiers.
2082	This name two legions received from Claudius because they had not fought against him in the insurrection of Camillus.
2083	These are preserved from the Augustan legions.
2084	Of the rest some have been scattered altogether and others were mixed in with different legions by Augustus himself and by the other emperors, from which circumstance they are thought to have been called Gemina.

2092	In the course of them an elephant vanquished a rhinoceros and a knight distinguished for his wealth fought as a gladiator.
2093	The people were encouraged by this honor shown to the memory of Drusus and by Tiberius's dedication of the temple of the Dioscuri, upon which he inscribed not only his name but also that of Drusus.
2094	Augustus suffered from old age and infirmity, so that he could not transact business for all that needed his aid some cases he

2099	Augustus went out into the suburbs to meet him, accompanied him to the Sæpta, and there from a platform greeted the people.

2103	It is you who without pausing to reflect on the foresight of the gods or the care of your forefathers are bent upon annihilating your whole race and making it in truth mortal, upon destroying and ending the whole Roman nation.
2104	You have incurred blood guiltiness by not begetting those who ought to be your descendants; you are sacrilegious in putting an

2108	The legions supported for it were very numerous, whereas the spoils taken were exceedingly meagre.
2109	Drusus, the son of Tiberius, although he had not participated in the war, was voted permission to attend the sittings of the

2110	Finally, Quintilius Varus received the command of Germany and in the discharge of his office strove, in administering the affairs of the people, to introduce more widespread changes among them.

2112	Three senators, as before, transacted business with the embassies, and the knights, a fact which might cause surprise, were allowed to fight as gladiators.

2118	Omens had appeared to him, not few by any means nor difficult to interpret, that pointed to this end.
2119	When a senatemeeting had been announced on account of his sickness in order that they might offer prayers, the senatehouse was found closed and an owl sitting upon it hooted.
2120	On the following day there was a senatemeeting, and to it the majority came wearing the equestrian costume, but the officials the senatorial, except for the purplebordered togas.
2121	Most of the members sat in their accustomed places, but the consuls below, one on the prætors' bench and one on the
2121	tribunes'. After this Tiberius was absolved for having touched the corpse, a forbidden act, and for having escorted it on its
2121	it into the senate. way, although the.... his will Drusus took from the virgin priestesses of Vesta, withwhom it had been deposited, and carried
2122	Those whohad sealed it viewed the impressions, and then it was read in hearingof the senate.
2123	In order that she, too, might have the benefit of his property he had asked permission of the senate to leave her so much, since it was contrary to law.
2124	He ordered many objects and sums of money to be given to many different persons, both relatives of his and those joined by no
2124	ties of kindred, not only to senators and knights but also to kings; for the people there were a thousand myriads and for the
2124	the native soldiery seventyfive each. soldiers two hundred and fifty denarii apiece to the Pretorians, half that amount to the city force, and to the remainder of
2125	This one was borne from the Palatium by the officials for the following year, and another of gold from the senatehouse, and still another upon a triumphal chariot.
2126	An image of Pompey the Great was also seen, and all the nations he had acquired, each represented by a likeness which bore some local characteristic, were carried in procession.
2127	But since the senate has wisely deemed him worthy of some kind of public utterance, I know that the speech was fittingly entrusted to me.
2128	If I am to do this sort of thing, I should be justified only if I looked at his deeds beside those of Hercules yet even then I
2128	should fail of my effect, inasmuch as the latter killed only serpents when he was a child, a stag and a boar when he was a
2128	man, oh, yes, and by Jupiter a lion also, though reluctantly and in obedience to a command; whereas our hero voluntarily made
2128	wars and enacted laws not among beasts but among men, carefully preserved the commonwealth, and himself gained brilliance.
2129	Soon after, seeing that the largest and best portion both of the people and of the senate was in accord with him, but that
2129	Lepidus and Antony, Sextus, Brutus, and Cassius were employing rebels, he feared that the city might become involved in many
2129	manipulated them very cleverly and to the greatest public good. wars, civil wars, at once, and be so torn asunder and exhausted as not to be able to revive in any fashion; and so he
2130	Why need I cite the other less important men? Pompey and Cæsar were in general guiltless of this conduct, but permitted their friends to do not a few things that were contrary to their own principles.
2131	And to what this action amounted you can best realize from the fact that our fathers spoke in praise of Pompey and Metellus, who was formerly prominent, because they voluntarily disbanded the forces with which they had been engaged in war.
2132	Though he supported such a large standing army to fight in your behalf, he let the soldiers be troublesome to none of his own countrymen but rendered them to outsiders most terrifying guardians, to the people at home unarmed and unwarlike.
2133	Cases difficult to decide he transferred from the people to the searching justice of the courts, but preserved to the popular body the dignity of the elections and trained citizens in these to seek a means of honor, not of strife.
2134	It is nothing surprising that he was occasionally the object of conspiracies, for even the gods do not please all alike.
2135	I have spoken, Quirites, of his greatest and most striking characteristics in a rather summary way.
2136	How can one forget a man who was in private life poor, in public life rich, saving in his own case but liberal of expenditures
2136	for others? one who even endured all toil and danger for you but would not submit to your escorting him when he went forth on
2136	any expedition or to your meeting him when he returned one who on festivals admitted even the populace to his home, but on
2136	other days greeted even the senate only in its chambers? How could one forget the number and precision as well of his laws,
2136	which contained for the wronged an allsufficient consolation and for the wrongdoers a not inhuman punishment? Or his rewards
2136	offered to those who married and had children? Or the prizes given to the soldiers without disadvantage to any other person?
2136	refusal to subjugate additional territory. Then there is the fact of his being satisfied with our possessions once for all acquired by the will of Destiny, and his
2137	What oblivion is dark enough to bury all this? It was for this, therefore, I say, that you naturally made him your head and a
2137	and published him as immortal. father of the people, that you decked him with many marks of esteem and numerous consulships and finally declared him a hero
2138	Hence we ought not either to mourn for him, but to give his body back now in due time to Nature, and to glorify his spirit, as that of a god, forever.
2139	Directly after, the same men as before took up the couch and carried it through the triumphal gateway, according to the senate's decree.
2140	There were present and took part in carrying him out the senate and the equestrian class, the women of his family, and the pretorian guard; and nearly everybody else in the city was in attendance.
2141	Next the centurions took torches, conformably to a decree of the senate, and kindled the fire from beneath.
2142	The people consequently were wont to recall these traits of his, and how he did not get blindly enraged at those who injured him as well as how he kept faith with even such as were unworthy of it.
2143	Though the people knew this during his life they nevertheless realized it more fully after his decease.
2144	An owl sat over the senatehouse again at the very first sitting of the senate after his death and uttered many illomened cries.
2145	At this time they declared Augustus immortal and assigned to him attendants and sacred rites, making Livia who was already called Julia and Augusta his priestess.
2146	A heroüm voted by the senate and built by Livia and Tiberius was erected to the dead emperor in Rome, and others at many different points, sometimes with the consent of the nations concerned and sometimes without their consent.
2147	This was the extent of the decrees passed in memory of Augustus nominally by the senate but really by Tiberius and Livia.
2148	They did not cease their disturbances until the tribunes convened the senate without delay and begged that body to allow them to spend something more than the legal amount.
2149	It was due to this characteristic that, as emperor, he sent a dispatch straight from Nola to the legions and provinces declaring that he was emperor.
2150	At a time when he was already surrounded by the bodyguards he asked the senate to help him escape suffering any violence at the burial of the emperor's body.
2151	One of these portions consisted of Rome and the rest of Italy, the second of the legions, the third of the subject peoples outside.
2152	Tiberius acted in this way at that time chiefly because it was his nature and he had determined upon that policy, but partly
2152	day and a favorite of theirs. also because he was suspicious of the Pannonian and Germanic legions and feared Germanicus, the ruler of the Germany of that
2153	He had previously made sure of the soldiers in Italy by means of the oaths established by Augustus; but as he was suspicious
2153	should revolt and prevail. of the others he waited for either possible outcome, intending to save himself by retiring to private life in case the legions
2154	For this Tiberius praised him and sent many pleasing messages both to him and to Agrippina he was not, however, pleased with his rival's progress but feared him all the more because he had won the attachment of the legions.
2155	Yet he displayed no sign of irritation toward them, but delivered many eulogies of Germanicus in the senate and proposed sacrifices to be offered in honor of his achievements as he did in the case of Drusus.
2156	He did little or nothing, that is, on his own responsibility, but brought even the smallest matters before the senate and communicated them to that body.
2157	In order to render his attitude more striking, he would let the first day of the month go by, not entering the senate nor
2157	pledges separately. showing himself at all in the City on that day, but spending the time in some suburb; then later he would come in and take
2158	He assisted many cities and individuals and enriched numerous senators who were poor and on that account were no longer willing to be members of the senate.
2159	On the occasion of festivals or so often as anything similar was going to afford the people leisure, he would go the evening
2159	before to one of the Cæsarians who lived near the places where there was sure to be a large crowd and there pass the night.
2160	His object was to make it possible for the people to meet him with a minimum of formality and fatigue.
2161	She occupied a position of great prominence, far above all women of former time, so that she could at any time receive the senate and such of the people as so wished to greet her in her house.
2162	Except that she never ventured to enter the senate or the camps or the public assemblies she undertook to man age everything like a sole ruler.
2163	For instance, she had once dedicated in her house an image to Augustus and in honor of the event wished to entertain the
2163	until the senate had voted it, and not even then to receive the men at dinner. senate and the knights together with their wives, but he would not grant her permission to carry out any part of this program
2164	In the consulship of Drusus his son and of Gaius Norbanus he presented to the people the bequests made by Augustus this was
2164	after some one had approached a corpse that was being carried out through the Forum for burial and bending down had whispered
2164	that they had got nothing as yet. something in its ear; when the spectators asked what he had said, he stated that he had commissioned the dead to tell Augustus
2165	At this time certain knights desired to enter a championship contest in the games which Drusus had arranged for his own
2165	to fight as a gladiator again. celebration and that of Germanicus; Tiberius did not view their combat, and when one of them was killed he forbade the other
2166	Now when Statilius Taurus was consul with Lucius Libo, Tiberius forbade any man to wear silk clothing and likewise to use gold ornaments, except for sacred ceremonies.
2167	Now there was a centurion who wished to give some evidence before the senate in Greek, and he would not allow it.
2168	Besides his unusual behavior in this respect he failed to pass sentence on Lucius Scribonius Libo, a young noble suspected of
2168	covered litter such as the wives of senators use to be condemned to death. revolutionary designs, so long as the latter was well; but upon his falling sick he had him brought into the senate in a
2169	Here one could catch a glimpse of the democratic constitution, inasmuch as the senate, approving the course of Gnaeus Calpurnius Piso, overcame Drusus and Tiberius and was itself subdued by the tribune.
2170	Therefore he summoned him on the charge of rebellious behavior and delivered him up to the votes of the senate.
2171	The condition of the prince was so serious that he was carried into the senate in a covered litter.
2172	orThe senate urged upon Tiberius the request that the month of November, on the sixteenth of which he had been born, should be called Tiberius; to which he responded "What will you do, if there arise thirteen Cæsars?" a.
2173	Their calm was further ruffled by an oracle, reputed to be a Sibylline utterance, which would not fit any other period of the city's history, but pointed to that very time.
2174	Tiberius denounced these verses as false and made an investigation of all the books containing any prophecies.
2175	Although on several occasions he might with the free consent not only of the soldiers but of the people and senate as well have obtained the imperial power, he refused to do so.
2176	Piso was brought before the senate by Tiberius himself on the charge of having murdered Germanicus, but succeeded in securing a postponement and committed suicide.
2177	When Tiberius began to hold the consular office in company with Drusus, men immediately began to prophecy destruction for Drusus from this very circumstance.
2178	For this he was tried in the senate, condemned and put to death.
2179	One of the prætors was accused of having uttered some impious word or having committed some impious act against him,
2179	complaint lodged at once. whereupon the man left the senate and taking off his robe of office returned, demanding as a private citizen to have the
2180	As a result, numerous images of this minister were made by many persons and many encomiuma were spoken both in the assembly and in the senate.
2181	At the time he entered the senate, delivered the appropriate eulogy over his child, and departed homeward.
2182	Tiberius took his way to thesenatehouse, where he lamented him publicly, put Nero and Drususchildren of Germanicus in charge
2182	of the senate, and exposed the bodyof Drusus upon the rostra; and Nero, being his soninlaw, pronouncedan eulogy over him.
2183	Ælius Saturninus he brought before the senate for trial on the charge of having recited some improper verses about him, and the culprit having been found guilty was hurled from the Capitol.
2184	Again, he brought Capito, procurator of Asia, before the senate, and, after charging him with using soldiers and acting in some other ways as if he had supreme command, he banished him.
2185	The ground of censure was that he had praised Cassius and Brutus and had attacked the people and the senate.
2186	Besides these events of the time that seem worthy to chronicle in a history, the people of Cyzicus were once more deprived of
2186	had begun to build. their freedom because they had imprisoned certain Romans and because they had not completed the heroüm to Augustus that they
2187	At this an uproar arose in the senate, which was calmed by Tiberius saying "I am no longer worthy to live, if Lentulus, too, hates me.
2188	This was the name of a celebrated gladiator of the time.
2189	The senate, however, did not content itself with voting merely the measures which he had ordained, but enjoined upon the women
2189	conduct of public business. mourning for her during the entire year, although it approved the course of Tiberius in not abandoning even at this time the
2190	It was voted that his birthday should be publicly observed, and the mass of statues which the senate and the equestrian order, the tribes and the foremost citizens set up, would have passed any one's power to count.
2191	Separate envoys were sent to both these "rulers" by the senate as well as the knights and also by the people, who selected them from their own tribunes and aediles.
2192	Therefore the emperor sent a report about him to the senate, making among other statements one to the effect that this man was jealous of his friendship for Sejanus, although Gallus himself treated Syriacus as an intimate friend.
2193	On the very same day he was banqueted at the house of Tiberius, pledging him in the cup of friendship, and was condemned before the senate.
2194	Instead, he bade Gallus in order to make his lot still more dismal to be of good cheer and instructed the senate that he
2194	suffer for the longest possible time both from deprivation of his civic rights and from terror. should be guarded without bonds until the emperor should reach the City; his object, as I said, was to make the prisoner
2195	Hence the latter appeared content to follow where Sejanus led, appointed him consul, and termed him Sharer of his Cares, repeating often the phrase "My Sejanus," and publishing the same by writing it to the senate and the people.
2196	Being accused of the crime of maiestas against Tiberius he took his will into the senatechamber and read it, showing that he had left his inheritance in equal portions to his children and to his sovereign.
2197	When he learned that the quæstor had arrived to attend to his execution, he wounded himself and displaying the wound to the official exclaimed "Report to the senate that it is thus one dies who is a man.
2198	Likewise, his wife, Mutilia Prisca, against whom some complaint was made, made her way into the senate and there stabbed herself with a dagger, which she had brought in secretly.
2199	Subsequently he took the auspices and not one bird of good omen appeared, but crows flew and cawed about him and then flew off all together to the jail, where they alighted.
2200	For, in view of the way things stood, not even if some god had plainly foretold that so great a change would take place in a short time, would any one have believed it.
2201	He sent many despatches of all kinds regarding himself to Sejanus and to the senate incessantly, saying at one time that he
2201	was poorly and just at the point of death, and again that he was in exceedingly good health and would reach Rome directly.
2202	Moreover, all the rest of the people were getting to feel dubious, because they heard alternately and at short intervals the
2202	they were wondering about Tiberius, thinking first that he was going to die and then that his arrival was imminent. most contrary reports, because they could no longer justify themselves in either admiring or despising Sejanus, and because
2203	And in writing to the senate about the death of Nero he used simply the name Sejanus, with no phrases added as had been his custom.
2204	In view of all this, the people began to look down on Sejanus more and more, to the point of drawing aside at his approach and leaving him alone, and that openly, without pretence of concealment.
2205	When Tiberius learned of it, his courage revived he felt that he should have the coöperation of the people and the senate, and accordingly began an attack upon his enemy.
2206	Then he despatched a communication against him to the senate by the hands of Nævius Sertorius Macro, whom he had privately appointed to command the bodyguards and had instructed as to precisely what must be done.
2207	At dawn Macro ascended the Palatine, where there was to be a session of the senate in the temple of Apollo.
2208	Sejanus, overjoyed at this, hastened to the senatechamber.
2209	Macro sent away to the camp the Pretorians that commonly surrounded the minister and the senate, after revealing to them his right as leader to do so and declaring that he brought documents from Tiberius that bestowed gifts upon them.
2210	First, before the people heard the letter, they were engaged in lauding the man, whom they supposed to be on the point of receiving the tribunician authority.
2211	Hence, after asking one person's opinion and obtaining a supporting vote in favor of imprisonment, he conducted the former favorite out of the senatechamber, and in company with the other officials and with Laco led him down to the prison.
2212	Him whom at dawn they had escorted to the senatehalls as one superior to themselves they were now dragging to a cell as if no better than the worst.
2213	Whom they were wont to adore and sacrifice to as to a god they were now leading to execution.
2214	For the moment he was merely cast into prison; but not much later, that very day, in fact, the senate assembled in the temple

2215	Not even the senate was quiet, but such members of it as had paid court to Sejanus were greatly disturbed by dread of
2215	that they had destroyed their victims out of regard for the minister instead of for Tiberius. reprisals; and those who had accused or borne witness against any persons were filled with fear by the prevailing suspicion
2216	To celebrate the ruin of the man whom they by the excess and novelty of their honors had led to destruction they voted solemnities that were not customary even for the gods.
2217	He had commanded Macro, or so some say, if there should be any uprising to bring Drusus before the senate and the people and appoint him emperor.
2218	When he learned that his enemy was dead, he rejoiced, as was natural, yet would not receive the embassy sent to congratulate him, though many members of the senate and many of the knights and of the populace had been despatched, as before.
2219	Also, with that same intention which had led him not to take possession of the wealth of those who perished voluntarily, he

2220	It had now long been the custom for the members of the senate on the first of the year to take the oath not man by man, but for one as I have stated to take the oath for them and the rest to express their acquiescence.
2221	They voted that he should select as many of their number as he liked and should employ twenty of them, whomsoever the lot should designate, as guards with daggers as often as he entered the senatechamber.
2222	And in order to assure the two classes still more fully how he felt toward both of them he not long after asked the senate that Macro and some military tribunes be deemed sufficient to conduct him to the senatechamber.
2223	The senate for these reasons acquitted him and in addition rebuked his accusers.
2224	Of the candidates for the other offices he selected as many as he wished and sent their names to the senate, recommending some
2224	senate or the decision of the lot. to that body, and these were chosen, by acclamation, but making others depend upon their own claims or the assent of the

2228	At the same time he requested the senate not to make the young man conceited by numerous or extraordinary honors, for fear the latter might go astray in one way or another.
2229	The emperor knew of no one else that suited him so entirely, and at the same time he was well aware that the man would be a
2229	thorough knave; yet the story obtains that he was glad to give him the empire in order that his own crimes might find

2230	He would have proceeded to Syria and taken possession of the legions, had not some one recognized him and putting an end to his success taken him to Tiberius.
2231	His children did not dare to publish it, but Tiberius, learning what had been written, ordered it to be presented before the senate.
2232	Indeed, he took all that Drusus had uttered in distress and misfortune, and this, too, he sent in to the senate.
2233	Thinking that it would be possible for him later to do whatever he liked at his leisure, he made no haste in any way and

2234	One woman wounded herself, was carried into the senate and from there to prison, where she died.

2236	This was evidenced by his allowing a mere boy to rule them, who had not yet the right even to enter the senate.
2237	Gaius need not have published it, since he was not unacquainted with the contents, but inasmuch as many knew what was in it
2237	rather to have the latter body overthrow it than to conceal the document. and it seemed likely that he himself on the one hand or the senate on the other would be blamed for its suppression, he chose
2238	In company with the senate he inspected the Pretorians while they were busy with exercises and distributed to them the two hundred and fifty denarii apiece that had been bequeathed, and he added as a gift as many more.
2239	To the people he paid the one thousand one hundred and twentyfive myriads this was the amount bequeathed to them and in
2239	with interest amounting to fifteen denarii more. addition the sixty denarii per man which they had failed to receive on the occasion of his enrollment among the iuvenes, this
2240	Sometimes, through fear of the people and the soldiers, he did so act, but it was mostly through whims.
2241	As it was, he lavished boundless sums upon dancers whose recall he at once effected, upon horses, upon gladiators and
2241	at the same time convicted himself of having done it through a sort of easygoing temper and indecision. everything of that sort; and so in an inconceivably short time he had exhausted the treasures, which had grown so great, and
2242	At first he seemed a most democratic person and would send no letters either to the people or to the senate nor assume any of
2242	the titles of sovereignty; yet he became most dictatorial, so that he took in one day all those honors which Augustus had with
2242	all. difficulty secured, voted one by one, during the long extent of his reign, some of which Tiberius had refused to accept at
2243	Again in the matter of Tiberius whom he also termed "grandfather", he asked that he might receive from the senate the same
2243	honors as Augustus; but these were not immediately voted, for the senators could not endure to honor that tyrant, nor did they
2243	make bold to dishonor him because they were not yet clearly acquainted with the character of their young lord, and
2243	than a public funeral, after bringing the body into the City by night and having it laid out at daybreak. consequently postponed everything until the latter should be present so then Gaius bestowed upon him no mark of notice other
2244	And though he did make a speech over it, he did not say so much in praise of Tiberius as he did to remind the people of Augustus and Germanicus, comparing himself meanwhile with them.
2245	Whereas once he requested the annulment of a decree that sacrifice should be offered to his Fortune, and had this action of his inscribed on a tablet, he afterward ordered temples and sacrifices to be prepared for him as for some god.
2246	For Tiberius always held the power in his own hands and used other people to help him carry out his wishes Gaius, on the other hand, was ruled by charioteers and by gladiators; he was the slave of dancers and other theatrical performers.
2247	Originally he was but a spectator and listener at these and would take sides for and against various performers like one of the mob; and sometimes, if he were irritated at his opponents, he would not visit the spectacle.
2248	And one night he urgently summoned the leaders of the senate as if to some important deliberation and then danced before them.
2249	The behavior of Gaius in these matters appeared satisfactory and to his actions corresponded the speech which he delivered in the senatehouse on entering upon his consulship.
2250	In it he denounced Tiberius for each of the crimes of which he was commonly accused and made many announcements about his own
2250	line of conduct; and the senate, fearing that he might change, issued a decree that his statements should be read annually.
2251	Boys of the noblest families, both of whose parents had to be living, together with maidens similarly circumstanced, sang the hymn, and the senators with their wives as well as the people were banqueted.
2252	The same ruler who gave to Antiochus son of Antiochus the district of Commagene, which his father had held, and likewise the
2252	coast districts of Cilicia, and had freed Agrippa grandson of Herod, who had been imprisoned by Tiberius, and had put him in

2253	On the other hand, there were Publius Afranius Potitus, a plebeian, who in a burst of foolish servility had promised not only

2254	On the very first day of the new year one Machaon, a slave, climbed upon the couch of Jupiter Capitolinus and after uttering from that place many dire prophecies killed a little dog which he had brought in with him and slew himself.
2255	Some of them he allowed to wear the senatorial costume occasionally even before they had held any office through which we enter the senate, on the strength of their hopes to secure admission to that body.
2256	He caused very great numbers of men to fight as gladiators, forcing them to contend both separately and in groups, drawn up in
2256	a kind of military formation he requested permission from the senate to do this, and again, something quite contrary to the
2256	spirit of the enacted law that he might do whatsoever he pleased, he asked leave to put to death a number of persons, among
2256	them twentysix knights, some of whom had already devoured their living, while others had merely practiced gladiatorial combat.
2257	The same trait of cruelty led him once, when there was a shortage of condemned criminals to be given to the beasts, to order some of the mob that stood near the benches to be seized and thrown to them.
2258	The Pretorians with their commander and the equestrian order by itself ran about the pyre  and the boys of noble birth
2258	performed the Troy exercise about her tomb; all the honors that had been given to Livia were voted to her, and it was further
2258	decreed that she should be declared immortal, that a figure in gold representing her be set up in the senatehouse, and that in
2258	the temple of Venus in the Forum there should be dedicated with equal honors a statue of her as large as that of the goddess.
2259	Women, as often as they gave testimony, should swear by her and on her birthday a festival equal to the Megalensia should be celebrated and the senate and the knights should hold a banquet.

2265	The emperor no longer made any concessions to the populace, opposing instead absolutely everything it wished, and consequently the people, too, resisted all his desires.
2266	The people could do nothing outside of discussion and showing their feelings by their demeanor, whereas Gaius dragged many of

2267	Later he returned to celebrate the birthday of Drusilla, brought into the hippodrome on a wagon her statue drawn by elephants and gave the people a free show for two days.
2268	He took the surviving combatants and sold them at an excessive valuation to the consuls, the prætors, and the rest, meeting
2268	with acquiescence from some and compelling others, who objected strenuously, to carry out his wishes at the horseraces; and
2268	as it might happen, should be allotted to take charge of the gladiatorial games. most of all he imposed upon the ones especially selected by lot for this purpose, for he had ordered that two prætors, just
2269	Many also came from outside to bid against them, particularly because he allowed such as wished to employ a greater number of gladiators than the law permitted and because he often had recourse to them himself.
2270	There was a senator, Gnæus Domitius Corbulo, who had noticed that the roads during the reign of Tiberius were in bad

2271	But now he entered the senatehouse and eulogized his predecessor at length, besides severely rebuking the senate and the people, saying that they did wrong in finding fault with him.
2272	And he told them besides "In case Tiberius really did do wrong, you ought not to have honored him while he lived, and at any rate, by Jupiter, you ought not to repudiate what you often said and voted.
2273	At the close of this address Gaius reintroduced the complaints for maiestas, ordered his commands to be inscribed upon a bronze tablet and rushing hastily from the senatehouse proceeded the same day to the suburbs of the capital.
2274	The senate and the people were filled with great fear as they thought of the denunciations against Tiberius, which they had often uttered, and of the many surprises his speech had had in store for them.
2275	Next he offered sacrifice to Neptune and some other gods and to Envy in order, he said, that no jealousy might attend him, and

2277	The decisions of the senate were merely made public, but when any men were condemned by Gaius their names were bulletined, as though he feared they might not learn their fate.
2278	There was no safety even for such as left the country, but many of them, too, lost their lives either on the road or while in

2279	The same is to be recorded of Titius Rufus, against whom a complaint was lodged that he had said the senate had one thing in their minds but uttered something different.
2280	So for this action, for which Afer had looked to be honored, he brought him before the senate and read a long speech against him.
2281	On the other hand Lucius Annæus Seneca, who was superior in wisdom to all the Romans of his day and to many other great men,

2282	Domitius was chosen as the emperor's colleague nominally by the people but actually by Gaius himself.
2283	However, he did not make an outright declaration of his destination, but went first to one of the suburbs and then suddenly started on his journey, taking with him many dancers, gladiators, horses, women, and the rest of the rout.
2284	His sisters for their connection with Lepidus he deported to the Portian islands, having first written to the senate a great deal of outrageous and brutal comment upon them.
2285	He sent to the senate at the time a report of the matter as if he had escaped some great plot, for he was always pretending to be in danger and to be leading a miserable existence.
2286	The people of Rome were disturbed by this behavior and were still further disturbed because a number of trials were hanging
2286	ædiles and prætors were compelled to resign their offices and stand trial. over their heads as a result of the friendship they had shown for his sisters and for the men who had been murdered even some
2287	All this, however, did not distress the people so much as their expectation that the cruelty and licentiousness of Gaius would go to still greater lengths.
2288	As a consequence, while he was consul for the third time no tribune nor prætor dared to convene the senate.
2289	At the time of the events just narrated they came together in the senatehouse after these proceedings, without any person
2289	having convened them, but accomplished nothing, wasting the whole day in laudations of Gaius and prayers in his behalf.
2290	Whenever he wished any business brought up he communicated in writing a small portion of it to all the senators, but most of it to the consuls, and then sometimes ordered this to be read in the senate.
2291	So much for the transactions of the senate.
2292	The shells he took back to Rome for the purpose of exhibiting the spoils to the people there as well.
2293	The senate did not see how it could remain inactive in the face of this procedure, inasmuch as it learned he was in an exalted frame of mind, nor yet again how it could praise him.
2294	Still, for all that, when Gaius entered the City he came very near devoting the whole senate to destruction because it had not voted him divine honors.
2295	The same emperor ordered the senate to convene and affected togrant its members amnesty, saying that there were only a very fewagainst whom he still retained his anger.
2296	This Protogenes once entered the senate as if on some indifferent business and when all, as was to be expected, saluted and
2296	greeted him, he darted a kind of sinister glance at Scribonius Proculus and said "Do you, too, greet me, though you hate the
2296	emperor so?" On hearing this all those present surrounded their fellow senator and tore him to pieces and voted some festivals
2296	enjoying the use of a military guard even there. to Gains as also that the emperor should have a high platform in the senatehouse to prevent any one's approaching him, besides
2297	Gaius was praised for this partly through fear and partly sincerely, and as some called him hero and others god, he fairly went out of his head.
2298	Even before this he was in the habit of demanding that he be given superhuman regard and said that he had intercourse with the Moon Goddess and was crowned by Victory.
2299	He also pretended to be Jupiter and took this as a pretext for having carnal knowledge of various women, especially his sisters.
2300	He would impersonate Hercules, Bacchus, Apollo, and all the other divinities, not merely males but also females.
2301	Once a certain Gaul, espying him on a, high platform transacting business in the guise of Jupiter, laughed aloud.
2302	Now this was the attire he would assume whenever he pretended to be some god; and there were suitable supplications, prayers, and sacrifices offered to it.
2303	Consequently the men who were kissed by him thanked him for it even in the senate, though all might see him kissing dancers every day.
2304	On one occasion Gaius declared he was enjoying converse with the Moon Goddess, and when he asked Vitellius if he could see the goddess with him, the other kept his eyes fixed on the ground, as if overcome by amazement.
2305	In a half whisper he answered "Only you gods, master, may behold one another.
2306	Thereupon he went to still greater lengths and built actually in Rome itself one temple of his own that was accorded him by vote of the senate, and another at his private expense on the Capitoline.
2307	He also planned a kind of dwelling on the Capitol, in order, as he said, that he might live in the same house with Jupiter.
2308	However, he disdained taking second place in this union of households and found fault with the god for occupying the Capitol
2308	should like to change that of Olympian Jove so as to resemble himself. before him accordingly, he hastened to construct another temple on the Palatine and by way of a statue for it thought he
2309	He gave the child the name of Drusilla, and taking her up to the Capitol placed her on the knees of Jupiter, with the implication that she was his child, and put her in charge of Minerva to be suckled.
2310	This god, then, this Jupiter, he was called by the latter name so much that it even found its way into documents, at the same time that all this took place was collecting money in most shameful and most frightful ways.
2311	One may, to be sure, leave out of account the wares and the taverns, the brothels  and the courts, the artisans and the
2311	wageearning slaves and other such sources from every single one of which he gathered funds; but how can one escape mentioning
2311	the rooms set apart in the very palace and the wives of the foremost men as well as the children of the most aristocratic
2311	families that he shut up in these rooms and foully abused, sparing absolutely no one in his greed for such victims, meeting
2311	with no resistance from some who wished to avoid showing any displeasure but seizing others quite against their will? Yet

2312	When, however, after enacting severe laws in regard to the taxes he inscribed them in exceedingly small letters on a tablet
2312	which he then hung up aloft so as to make sure that it should be read as little as possible and that many through ignorance of

2313	Once the people had come together in the hippodrome and were objecting to his conduct, and he had them cut down by the soldiers.
2314	Again, an oracle had a short time before warned Gaius to beware of Cassius.
2315	So Gaius, who accomplished all these exploits in three years, nine months, and twentyeight days, learned by actual experience that he was not a god.
2316	All such persons as in any way acknowledged the authority of thesenate obeyed their oaths and became once more quiet.
2317	Boissevain remarks that this sentence may be interpreted to mean "All persons incurred equal censure whether they showed
2317	goddess," but adds that the text is open to suspicion. pleasure at decrees passed in her honor, as being grieved at her death, or behaved as if they were glad that she had become a
2318	in it"? Boissevain According to Boissevain, this is very probably a MS. error for Jupiter Latiaris.
2319	When Gaius perished in the manner described, the consuls despatched guards to every quarter of the city and gathered the senate on the Capitol, where many diverse opinions were uttered.
2320	The consuls for a time sent tribunes and others forbidding him to assume any such authority and to submit to the jurisdiction

2321	Hence his voice was also faltering and he did not himself read all the measures that he introduced before the senate but would give them to the quæstor to read, though at first, at least, he was regularly present.
2322	From a child he had been reared with careful nursing and in the midst of terror and had for that reason feigned simplicity to
2322	a greater extent than was really true this fact he himself admitted in the senate and as he had lived for a long time with his

2323	All honors voted to him he immediately accepted, except the title "Father," and this he afterward took yet he did not at once enter the senate, but delayed as late as the thirtieth day.
2324	Nearly every day either in company with the entire senate or alone he would sit on a platform trying cases, generally in the Forum, but occasionally elsewhere.
2325	Yet, when the senate manifested a desire to dishonor Gaius, he personally prevented such a measure from being voted, but on his own responsibility caused all of his predecessor's images to disappear by night.
2326	He forbade the prætors' giving gladiatorial games and ordained that any one else who superintended them in any place
2326	preservation. whatsoever should not allow to be written or reported the statement that such games were being held for the emperor's
2327	For instance, when this year he betrothed one of his daughters to Lucius Junius Silanus and gave the other in marriage to
2327	those days and convened the senate as usual. Gnæus Pompeius Magnus, he did nothing out of the common to commemorate the occasion, but attended the courts in person on
2328	In addition, when at one time in the senate the consuls came down from their seats to talk with him, he rose in turn and went to meet them.
2329	He restored to the various cities the statues which Gaius was in the habit of requiring them to send, restored also to the Dioscuri their temple and to Pompey the right of naming the theatre.
2330	It was at this time that Claudius marked off the space which still belongs to the senate, and furthermore he allowed those senators who chose to view the sights somewhere else and even in citizen's dress.
2331	They were allowed to enter the senate and to express their thanks to him in Greek.
2332	No sooner had he taken this advice than so much rain burst from heaven as to allay the soldiers' thirst entirely, beside scaring the enemy, who thought the gods were assisting the Roman.
2333	And he would not permit those chosen by election to express any thanks to him in the senate, this had been a kind of custom
2333	with them, but he said "These persons ought not to thank me, as if they were so eager for office, but I them, because they
2333	cheerfully help me bear the burden of government and if they acquit themselves well in office, I shall praise them still more.
2334	Such men as by reason of insufficient means were not able to be senators he allowed to ask permission to retire, and he

2335	In the senate the emperor would himself regularly rise in case the rest had been standing for a long time.
2336	He was constantly arranging gladiatorial games, taking a degree of pleasure in them that aroused criticism.
2337	He received abundant praise, however, for appearing in the people's midst at the spectacle, for giving them all they wanted, and for his employing a herald so very little and announcing most events by notices written on boards.
2338	Later he recovered courage and rewarded his soldiers among other methods by having the citizen legions the seventh and the eleventh named the Claudian, and the Faithful, and the Pious, by the senate itself.
2339	Trials were held in the senatehouse in the presence of Claudius, his prefects, and his freedmen.
2340	It was at this time that a certain Galæsus, a freedman of Camillus, was brought into the senate and talked with the utmost frankness on a variety of subjects.
2341	He kept throwing out many other hints of that sort in Greek both to them and to the senate, with the result that those who could understand any of them laughed at him.
2342	And the tribunes at the death of one of their number themselves convened the senate for the purpose of appointing a tribune to succeed him, this in spite of the fact that the consuls were accessible.
2343	During the investigation, which was conducted in the senatehouse, he put a question in the Latin tongue to one of the envoys who had originally been a Lycian but had been made a Roman.
2344	Thence advancing partly by land and partly along the water courses he came to the ocean and crossed over to Britain, where he joined the legions that were waiting for him near the Thames.
2345	The senate on learning of his achievement gave him the title of Britannicus and allowed him to celebrate a triumph.
2346	The performers in the theatre gave, with the consent of the senate, another festival likewise intended to commemorate the victory.

2348	And Umbonius Silio, governor of Bætica, was summoned and ejected from the senate because he had sent so little grain to the soldiers then serving in Mauretania.
2349	Now since the City was becoming filled with numbers of images, for those who wished might without restrictions appear in

2350	Persons who preferred a request to leave Italy for a time were given permission by Claudius himself without action of the
2350	senate; yet, in order to appear to be doing it under some form of law, he ordered that a decree to the effect be issued.
2351	The people were truly loud in praise of Claudius for his moderation, and also, by Jupiter, at the fact that he showed
2351	helper in his cause. displeasure when a certain man sought the aid of the tribunes against the person who had freed him, asking and securing thus a
2352	This feeling was especially marked on an occasion when Claudius himself and all the rest were anxious to kill Sabinus former
2352	governor of the Celtæ in the reign of Gains in a gladiatorial fight, but the latter approached Messalina and she saved him.
2353	But whenever any talk about his not dancing sprang up among the people, Claudius would appear surprised and make various apologies, taking oath that he was not at his house.
2354	For he pleased the people as much by his skill as he did the empress by his beauty.
2355	Claudius now ejected some members of the senate, the majority of whom were not sorry to be driven out but willingly stood aside on account of their poverty.
2356	In the course of the armed combat of gladiators many foreign freedmen and British captives fought.
2357	On the heels of this occurrence Vitellius came forward in the senate witha declaration that the good of the State required Claudius to marry.
2358	She accomplished these ends partly by causing the freedmen to persuade Claudius and partly by seeing to it beforehand that the senate, the populace, and the soldiers should always concur to favor her demands.
2359	Agrippina quickly became a second Messalina, and chiefly because she obtained from the senate among other honors the right to use the carpentum at festivals.
2360	She would not let him visit his father nor appear before the people, but kept him in a kind of imprisonment, though without bonds.
2361	Agrippina wore a beautiful chlamys woven with gold, and the rest of the people whatever pleased their fancy.
2362	A man whom Gallicus had disappointed came to Domitius for assistance, whereupon the latter said to him "And who told you I
2362	should regain his health. could swim better than he can?" Later Claudius fell sick, and Nero entered the senate to promise ahorserace in case Claudius
2363	Again, afterinstigating a riot over the sale of bread she persuaded Claudius to makeknown to the populace by public bulletin and to write to the senatethat, if he should die, Nero was fully capable of administering publicinterests.
2364	It seemed that indications of this event were given in advance by the comet star, which was seen over a wide expanse of
2364	territory, by the shower of blood, by the bolt that descended upon the standards of the Pretorians, by the opening of its own

2365	He declared mushrooms to be the food of the gods, because Claudius by means of a mushroom had become a god.
2366	Yet Domitius, the father of Nero, had a sufficient previous intimation of his son's coming baseness and licentiousness, not by any oracle but through the nature of his own and Agrippina's characters.
2367	Before the senate he read such a considerable document, this, too, written by Seneca, that it was voted the statements should be inscribed on a silver tablet and should be read every time the new consuls took up the duties of their office.
2368	Next he came to despise instruction, inasmuch as he was always hearing from his associates, "Do you submit to this?" or "Do
2368	you fear these people?", "Don't you know that you are Caesar?", "Have not you the authority over them rather than they over
2368	admit the greater good sense of Seneca and Burrus. you?" He was also animated by obstinacy, not wishing to acknowledge his mother as superior and himself as inferior, nor to
2369	There was a certain Marcus Salvius Otho, who through similarity of character and sharing in wrongdoing had become so intimate with Nero that he was not even punished for saying one day to the latter "Then I hope you may see me Caesar.
2370	He was likewise incited, so many trustworthy men have stated, by Seneca, whether it was to obscure the complaint against his

2374	The hairs he cast into a small golden globe and offered to Jupiter Capitolinus.
2375	There stood Caesar on the stage wearing the garb of a singing zitherplayer.
2376	whilst many soldiers stood by and all the people that the seats would hold sat watching.
2377	One could hear them saying "Excellent Caesar! Apollo! Augustus! One like unto the Pythian! By thine own self, O Caesar, no one

2378	At night there was heard to issue from the senatehouse foreign jargon mingled with laughter and from the theatre outcries with wailing yet no mortal man had uttered the speeches or the groans.
2379	Why is it that though none of us has any money, and how or whence should we get it?, we are stripped and despoiled like a
2379	murderer's victims? How should the Romans grow milder in process of time, when they have conducted themselves so toward us at
2379	the very start, a period when all men show consideration for even newly captured beasts?  "But, to tell the truth, it is we
2379	who have made ourselves responsible for all these evils in allowing them so much as to set foot on the island in the first

2383	Yet even should the outcome prove contrary to our hope, and I will not shrink from mentioning even this contingency, it is
2383	better for us to fall fighting bravely than to be captured and impaled, to see our own entrails cut out, to be spitted on red

2384	Again, one time after the slaughter of beasts he straightway brought water into the theatre by means of pipes and produced a seafight then he let the water out again and arranged a gladiatorial combat.
2385	So a slave debauched his mistress in the presence of his master and a gladiator ravished a girl of noble family while her father looked on.
2386	The populace invoked curses upon Nero without intermission, not uttering his name but simply cursing those who had set the
2386	day. city on fire and this was especially the case because they were disturbed by the memory of the oracle chanted in Tiberius's
2387	Compare Book Fiftyseven, chapter.  And when Nero by way of encouraging them reported that these verses were nowhere to be

2394	Everything was in readiness by the time night drew to a close and at daybreak Nero, wearing the triumphal garb and accompanied by the senate and the Pretorians, entered the Forum.
2395	Rome was not enough for him, nor Pompey's theatre, nor the great hippodrome, but he desired also a foreign tour, in order to become, as he said, victor in all the four contests.
2396	So how could one endure to hear about, let alone seeing, an emperor, an Augustus, listed on the program among the contestants,

2398	The whole population of Rome and Italy he surrendered like captives to a certain Helius, a Caesarian.
2399	In most respects they behaved entirely alike, and the one point of difference was that the descendant of Augustus was emulating zitherplayers, whereas the freedman of Claudius was emulating Caesars.
2400	Again, whether from vexation at Apollo for making some unpleasant predictions to him or because he was merely crazy, he took away from the god the territory of Cirrha and gave it to the soldiers.
2401	In fact, he abolished the oracle, slaying men and throwing them into the rock fissure from which the divine afflatus arose.
2402	The proclamation ran "Nero Caesar wins this contest and crowns the Roman people and his world.
2403	His hatred for the senate was so fierce that he took particular pleasure in Vatinius, who kept always saying to him "I hate you, Caesar, for being of senatorial rank.
2404	As for the doings of the senate, it would be a task to describe them all in detail.

2406	After passing in this manner through the hippodrome and through the Forum in company with the soldiers and the knights and the senate he ascended the Capitol and proceeded thence to the palace.
2407	The city was all decked with garlands, was ablaze with lights and smoky with incense, and the whole population, the senators
2407	themselves most of all, kept shouting aloud "Vah, Olympian Victor! Vah Pythian Victor! Augustus! Augustus! Hail to Nero the
2407	Hercules, hail to Nero the Apollo!! The one National Victor, the only one from the beginning of time! Augustus! Augustus! O,

2408	And ascending a tribunal he delivered a long and detailed speech against Nero, saying that they ought to revolt from the
2408	emperor and join him in an attack upon him, "because," said he, "he has despoiled the whole Roman world, because he has

2412	It is hard to say whether this was merely because he did not deem it right for the soldiers to bestow the supreme authority
2412	and felt no personal desire for the imperial power, to secure which others were willing to do everything. upon any one for he declared this to be the prerogative of the senate and the people, or because he was entirely highminded
2413	He did not hurry back to Rome but merely sent a letter to the senate, in which he asked them to regard leniently his nonarrival, because he had a sore throat, implying that when he did come he wanted to sing to them.
2414	He enjoyed the same degree of luxury; and upon the completion and adornment of the heroum of Sabina he gave it a brilliant dedication, taking care to have inscribed upon it "The Women have built This to Sabina, the Goddess Venus.
2415	He was on the point of putting those measures into effect when the senate first withdrew the guard that surrounded Nero, then entered the camp, and declared Nero an enemy but chose Galba in his place as emperor.
2416	Closely veiled he rode while it was yet night towards an estate of Phao, a Caesarian, in company with the owner of the place, and Epaphroditus and Sporus.
2417	Galba, now that Nero had been destroyed and the senate had voted him the imperial authority and Rufus had made advances to him, plucked up courage.
2418	However, He did not adopt the name "Caesar," until envoys of the senate had paid him a visit.

2421	ready to take her into his house; and if she should be barred out much longer she should take up her abode with some one else.

2424	As he reached the middle of the Roman Forum, horsemen and footsoldiers met him and then and there cut down in the presence of many senators and crowds of plebeians the old man, their consul, high priest, Caesar, emperor.
2425	When the soldiers had done this, they cut off their heads, which they then carried to Otho who was in the camp and also into the senatehouse; and the senators, though terrorstricken, affected to be glad.
2426	Piso perished after him, making this atonement for having been appointed Caesar.
2427	As he was offering his first sacrifice, the omens were seen to be unfavorable, so that he repented of what had been done and

2437	Vitellius, when Priscus opposed him in the senate and denounced one of the soldiers, called the tribunes to his side as if he had some need of their assistance.
2438	While he was behaving in this way, evil omens occurred.

2440	who had suffered sentence of exile in Nero's reign but had been restored by Galba and was commander of the legion in Pannonia.
2441	This man held supreme authority, although not chosen by the emperor nor by the senate.
2442	Vitellius when he heard about it remained where he was and went on with his luxurious living even to the extent of arranging gladiatorial combats.
2443	As the sun was rising the soldiers of the third legion, called the Gallic, that wintered in Syria but was now by chance in the party of Vespasian, suddenly according to custom saluted the Sun God.
2444	Omens had contributed to make him uneasy.
2445	He had been offering a certain sacrifice, and after it was addressing the soldiers, when a lot of vultures swooped down, scattered the sacred meats, and nearly knocked him from the platform.
2446	At times he was inclined to surrender himself for the public welfare, and later he would clasp his child in his arms, kiss him, and hold him out to the people as if to arouse their pity.
2447	And having convened the senate he sent envoys chosen from that body together with the vestal virgins to Cerialis as envoys.
2448	They seized him, a mass of shavings and blood for the dogs had done him some harm already and stripping off his clothes they

2460	Such was the course of events on the heels of which Vespasian was declared emperor by the senate and Titus and Domitian were given the title of Caesars.
2461	From a dream he learned that when Nero Caesar should lose a tooth, he should be emperor and this matter of the tooth became a reality on the following day.
2462	Nero himself in his slumbers thought he was bringing the chariot of Jupiter to Vespasian's house.
2463	A certain Julius Sabinus, one of the foremost of the Lingones, collected by his own efforts a separate force and took the name of Caesar, declaring that he was a descendant of Julius Caesar.
2464	In this way they damaged the wall and unintentionally burned down the barrier encompassing their sacred precinct.
2465	To commemorate the event it was ordered that the conquered, while still preserving their own ancestral customs should annually pay a tribute of two denarii to Capitoline Jupiter.
2466	He doesn't understand being Caesar.
2467	The astrologers he banished from Rome, yet he consulted all of them who were distinguished, and through the influence of Barbillus, a man of that profession, allowed the Ephesians to celebrate some sacred games.
2468	On reaching Rome he bestowed gifts upon both soldiers and populace; he made repairs in the sacred precincts and upon those
2468	completed he inscribed upon them not his own name but the names of the persons who had originally reared them. public works which showed signs of wear and tear; such as had already crumbled to decay he restored; and when they were
2469	Thus he made it quite plainly evident that he was amassing riches not for his own enjoyment but for the needs of the people.
2470	He was a regular visitor in the senate, whose members he consulted in regard to all projects, and he frequently tried cases in the Forum.
2471	Whatever measures he was prevented by old age from reading aloud, as well as any communications that he sent to the senate when absent, he usually caused to be read by his sons, showing honor by this course to the legislative body.
2472	Therefore the tribunes once arrested him and gave him in charge of their assistants, at which procedure Vespasian was overcome
2472	one at all. by emotion and went out of the senatehouse in tears, uttering this single exclamation only "A son shall be my successor or no
2473	In the sixth year of Vespasian as magistrate and the fourth of Titus the precinct of Peace was dedicated and the socalled Colossus was set up on the Sacred Way.
2474	He did not particularly enjoy gladiatorial combats of men, although Titus during the youthful sports which were celebrated in his own land had once had a sham fight in heavy armor with Alienus.
2475	Moreover, Sabinus the Gaul, already mentioned, the person who had once named himself Caesar, had later taken up arms, had been defeated and had hidden himself in the monument, was discovered  The meaning is clear.
2476	She had presented her children before Vespasian and had delivered a most pitiful speech in their behalf "These little ones, Caesar, I both brought forth and reared in the monument, that we might be a greater number to supplicate you.
2477	Marcellus was brought to trial before the senate and was condemned, whereupon he cut his own throat with a razor.
2478	To those who said anything to him about the comet he responded "This is an omen not for me but for the Parthian king.
2479	When he at length came to the belief that he was to die, he said only "Now I shall become a god.
2480	There, too, no little fear was felt for several days, since the people did not know and could not conjecture what had happened.
2481	It consumed the temple of Serapis, the temple of Isis, the Saepta, the temple of Neptune, the Baths of Agrippa, the Pantheon,
2481	books, and the temple of Capitoline Jupiter with its surrounding temples. the Diribitorium, the theatre of Balbus, the stagebuilding of Pompey's theatre, the Octavian buildings together with their
2482	There, on the first day, a gladiatorial combat and slaughter of beasts took place; this was done by building a structure of planks over the lake that faced the images and placing benches round about it.
2483	Titus also contributed some things that were of practical use to the people.
2484	When he had finished this exhibition, he wept so bitterly on the last day that all the people saw him, and after this time he
2484	performed no other great deed; but the following year, in the consulship of Flavius  L. Flavius Silva Nonius Bassus.
2485	The divinity that he chiefly revered was Minerva, so that he was wont to celebrate the Panathenaea on a magnificent scale on this occasion he had contests of poets and chroniclers and gladiators almost every year at Albanum.
2486	Personally, he paid no attention to those who praised Titus for not causing a single senator's death, nor did he care that the
2486	senate frequently saw fit to pass decrees that the emperor should not be permitted to put to death any of his peers.
2487	Then on petition of the people he became reconciled, to be sure, with Domitia, but continued none the less his relations with Julia.
2488	It is further reported that since their examination was conducted in a harsh and unfeeling manner, and many of them were
2488	expired there in the senate where he sat. accused and constantly being punished, one of the pontifices, Helvius Agrippa, could not endure it, but, horrorstricken,
2489	And what need is there of mentioning the honors bestowed upon him at this juncture for his exploit or from time to time upon
2489	the other emperors who were like him? For the object in any case was simply not to arouse the rage of those despots by letting
2489	them suspect, in consequence of the small number and insignificance of the rewards, that the people saw through them.
2490	Notwithstanding he affected to take pleasure in the honorary decrees voted him by the senate.
2491	Subsequently, being still more puffed up by his folly, he was elected consul for ten years in succession, and first and only
2491	garb whenever he entered the senatehouse. censor for life of all private citizens and emperors and he obtained the right to employ twentyfour lictors and the triumphal
2492	For, as he had no resources for his expenditures, he murdered numbers of men, bringing some of them before the senate and accusing others in their absence.
2493	Many of the peoples tributary to the Romans revolted when contributions of money were forcibly extorted from them.
2494	Domitian experienced a thrill of delight at the news and remarked to the senate "Well, I have put a ban on the existence of the Nasamones.
2495	Even as early as this he was insisting upon being regarded as a god and took a huge pleasure in being called "master" and "god.
2496	I call the people Dacians, just as they name themselves and as the Romans do; but I am not ignorant that some of the Greeks refer to them as Getae, whether that is the right term or not.
2497	A great rain and violent storm had suddenly come up, yet he allowed no one to leave the spectacle; indeed, though he himself changed his clothing to a thick woolen cloak, he would not permit the people to alter their attire.
2498	So at this time he feasted the populace as described, but on another occasion he entertained the foremost men of the senate and the knights in the following fashion.
2499	Furthermore, he did not even make any communication to the senate regarding those put out of the way, although he sent their heads as well as that of Antonius to Rome and exposed them in the Forum.
2500	But one young man, Julius Calvaster, who had served as military tribune in the hope of getting into the senate, was saved in a most unexpected fashion.
2501	He expelled Caecilius Rufinus from the senate because he danced, and restored Claudius Pacatus, though an excenturion, to his master because he was proved to be a slave.
2502	Then he killed Arulenus Rusticus for being a philosopher and for calling Thrasea sacred, and Herennius Senecio because in his
2502	long career he had stood for no office after the quaestorship and because he had compiled the life of Helvidius Priscus.

2506	Subsequently in the senate he designated him Caesar and sent a message to him, written with his own hand Trajan was governor of Germany "The Danaans by thy weapons shall requite my tears.

2508	He thought that an old man in purple robe and vesture, moreover adorned with a crown, as the senate is represented in pictures, impressed a seal upon him with a finger ring, first on the left side of his throat and then on the right.
2509	When he had been made emperor, he sent a despatch to the senate written with his own hand, which stated, among other things, that he would not slay nor dishonor any man of worth.
2510	His meetings with the people were marked by affability and his intercourse with the senate by dignity.
2511	He also sent envoys to the senate to secure these terms, in order that he might have the further ratification of the peace by that body.
2512	The envoys from Decebalus were introduced in the senate.
2513	Trajan celebrated a triumph and was given the title of Dacicus; in the theatre he had contests of gladiators, in whom he delighted, and he brought back dancers once more to the theatre, being in love with one of them, Pylades.
2514	And since Decebalus was reported to him to be acting in many ways contrary to the treaty, since he was gathering arms,
2514	receiving such as deserted, repairing the forts, sending ambassadors to the neighbors, and injuring those who had previously

2515	At these affairs thousands, yes, possibly tens of thousands of animals, both wild and tame, were slaughtered, and fully ten thousand gladiators fought in combat.
2516	Those, however, who conspired against him among whom was Crassus he brought before the senate and caused to be punished.
2517	When he had captured the whole country of Armenia and had won over also many of the kings, some of whom, since they submitted,

2526	This was shown also by his letters to the senate, the signature upon which was not his, but Plotina's.

2534	No one of his associates, moreover, displayed insolence nor sold aught that he should pronounce or perform, as the Caesarians and other attendants in the suite of emperors have made it their custom to do.
2535	On his own birthday he gave a spectacle to the people free of charge, and slaughtered numbers of wild beasts, one hundred lions and a like number of lionesses biting the dust on this one occasion.
2536	After this he passed through Judaea into Egypt and offered sacrifice to Pompey, about whom, he is said to have uttered this

2541	Wherefore Hadrian in writing to the senate did not employ the opening phrase commonly affected by the emperors "If you and your children are in health, it shall be well I and the armies are in health.

2545	Consequently, he appointed as Caesar for the Romans Lucius Commodus, although this man frequently vomited blood.

2561	Marcus, on hearing this, made an appeal to them to pray to their God.
2562	And when they had prayed, the God immediately gave ear, hurling a thunderbolt upon the enemy and encouraging the Romans with rain.
2563	Marcus was astounded at what happened and honored the Christians by an official decree, while the legion he named "The Thunderbolt.
2564	And although he was not wont to accept any such honor before the senate voted it,  Cp.
2565	nevertheless this time he took it under the assumption that it was bestowed from Heaven, and he sent a despatch to that effect to the senate.
2566	Moreover Faustina was named "Mother of the Legions.
2567	He was so upset at the news that he did not even communicate to the senate the basis of the reconciliation made with them, as he was wont to do in all other cases.
2568	Is it not afflicting for us to meet war after war? Is it not absurd to be involved in civil conflict? Are not both these

2569	This is what Marcus both said to the soldiers and wrote to the senate, in no place abusing Cassius, save he constantly termed him ungrateful.
2570	He did not so much as bring them before his own court, but merely sent them before the senate, nominally under some other complaint, and appointed them a fixed day on which to have their case heard.
2571	Marcus was so averse to slaughter that he saw to it that the gladiators in Rome contended without danger, like athletes; for he never permitted any of them to have any sharp iron, but they fought with blunt weapons, rounded off at the ends.
2572	And so far was he from countenancing any slaughter that though at the request of the populace he ordered to be brought in a

2573	In his great grief over the death of Faustina he wrote to the senate that no one of those who had cooperated with Cassius was dead, as if in this fact alone he could find some consolation for Faustina's loss.
2574	So pure and excellent and godfearing did he show himself throughout his career.
2575	To such an extent did he refrain from inventing any imaginary conspiracy and concocting any tragedy that had not taken place,
2575	that he released even those who most openly rose against him and took arms against him and against his son, whether they were
2575	any other arrangement whatever. generals or heads of tribes or kings, and he put none of them to death either by his own action or by that of the senate or by
2576	It was voted by the senate that silver images of Marcus and Faustina should be set up in the temple of Venus and Roma, and
2576	that an altar should be erected whereon all the maidens married in the city and their bridegrooms should offer sacrifice; also
2576	that a golden image of Faustina should be carried in a chair to the theatre on each occasion that the emperor should be a

2578	Marcus also asked the senate for money from the public treasury, not because it had not been placed in the sovereign's authority, but because Marcus was wont to declare that this and everything else belonged to the senate and the people.
2579	We," said he speaking to the senate, "are so far from having anything of our own that we even live in a house of yours.
2580	After he was dead he obtained many marks of honor and was set up in gold within the senatehouse itself.
2581	So this was the manner of Marcus's demise, who besides all other virtues was so godfearing that even on the dies nefasti he sacrificed at home; and he ruled better than any that had ever been in power.
2582	Most of his life he passed in the service of beneficence, and therefore he erected on the Capitol a temple to that goddess and called her by a most peculiar name, which had never before been current.

2593	And the Caesarians, having got rid of this man, with Cleander at their head entered upon every form of outrage, selling all privileges, doing violence, plunging into licentiousness.
2594	Yet this victim had possessed very great influence, so that the Nicomedeans obtained from the senate the right of holding a series of games and of building a temple to Commodus.
2595	It came to be said of Julius Solon an exceedingly obscure man that he had been deprived of his property and banished to the senate.
2596	The children shouted many wild words of complaint, which the people took up again and began to bawl anything that came into their heads.
2597	Boissevain suggests that the "Roman Hercules" perhaps feared that Alexander might diminish his glory.
2598	He gave orders that Rome itself be called Commodiana, the legions "Commodian," and the day on which this measure was voted "Commodiana.
2599	Upon himself he bestowed, in addition to very many other titles, that of Hercules.
2600	And to the senate he would send a despatch couched in these terms "Caesar Imperator, Lucius Aelius Aurelius Commodus,

2603	Of this, too, he saved not the smallest part, but spent it all disgracefully on beasts and gladiators.

2606	His antagonist would be some professional athlete, or, perhaps, gladiator, with a cane; this was sometimes a man that the emperor himself challenged and sometimes one that the people chose.
2607	In this and other matters he acted the same way as the other gladiators, except that they go in for a very small sum, whereas Commodus had twentyfive myriads from the gladiatorial fund given him each day.
2608	The first day he personally paired all the combatants, either down below, where he wore all the attire of Mercury, including a gilded wand, or else from his place on the elevated platform; and we took his proceeding as an omen.
2609	Besides all the rest that we did, we shouted whatever we were bidden and this sentence continuously "Thou art lord, and thou
2609	art foremost, of all most fortunate thou dost conquer, thou shalt conquer; from everlasting, Amazonian, thou dost conquer!"

2611	After this occurrence he raised our spirits, since before fighting again as a gladiator he bade us enter the theatre in the equestrian garb and with woolen cloaks.
2612	Commodus was anxious to slay both the consuls Erucius Clarus and Sosius Falco and on the first of the month to issue as consul and secutor at once from the place where the gladiators are kept.
2613	Let no one be incredulous about this, for he even cut off the head of the Colossus and put one of his own there instead; and

2619	In stead, they termed him "wretch" and "tyrant," adding in jest titles like "the gladiator," "the charioteer," "the lefthanded," "the ruptured man.
2620	He was wont to live mostly in the country on account of Commodus and very seldom came down to the city, making his age and a disease of the eyes his excuse and he had never before, when I was present, entered the senate.
2621	Pertinax honored him mightily in every way and in the senate made him take the seat beside him.
2622	Pertinax therefore had difficulty in raising money from the images and the arms, the horses and the trappings, and the favorites of Commodus, but gave to the Pretorians all that he had promised and to the people one hundred denarii apiece.
2623	Yet he was unwilling to make his wife Augusta or his son Caesar, though we voted him permission.
2624	Now, since the soldiers were no longer allowed to plunder nor the Caesarians to indulge their licentiousness, they hated him bitterly.
2625	The Caesarians attempted no revolt, because they were unarmed, but the Pretorian soldiers and Laetus formed a plot against him.
2626	The latter, learning of the plan, returned in haste to the City, and coming before the senate said "You should not be

2627	It is the surprising Caesarians who have been responsible for this deficiency of funds.
2628	The soldiers and the Caesarians, who were present in the senate in great numbers, became mightily indignant and muttered dangerously.
2629	No one of their fellow soldiers had barred the way, and the porters and other Caesarians so far from making any door fast had opened absolutely all the entrances.
2630	The sellers were the people who had killed their emperor, and the wouldbe buyers were Sulpicianus and Julianus, who vied to outbid each other, one from within, the other from without.
2631	So toward evening the new ruler turned his steps with speed toward the Forum and senatehouse.
2632	and dinner were both over, we pushed our way through the soldiers, entered the senatehouse, and heard the potentate deliver a

2633	I am here alone" is what he said, when he had surrounded the entire exterior of the senatehouse with heavily armed men and had a number of soldiers in the senatehouse itself.
2634	In this way he got his imperial power confirmed also by decrees of the senate and returned to the palace.
2635	Finally, when he came to the senatehouse and was about to sacrifice to Janus before the entrance, all bawled out as if by preconcerted arrangement, terming him empireplunderer and parricide.
2636	That excited the populace a great deal more, and it did not cease expressing its longing for Pertinax or its abuse of Julianus, its invocations of the gods or its curses upon the soldiers.
2637	Julianus after seizing the power in this way managed affairs in a servile fashion, paying court to the senate as well as to men of any influence.
2638	The senate had at one time voted him a golden statue and he refused to accept it, saying "Give me a bronze one so that it may

2640	These were the three persons darkly indicated by the three stars that suddenly came to view surrounding the sun, when Julianus in our presence was offering the Sacrifices of Entrance in front of the senatehouse.
2641	So he sent a letter by one of his trusted managers to Albinus, creating him Caesar.
2642	Of Niger, who was proud of having been invoked by the people, he had no hopes.
2643	Julianus on learning the condition of affairs had the senate make Severus an enemy and proceeded to prepare against him.
2644	The soldiers were present, conspicuous by their arms, as if participating  Reading Greek pompeyontes Dindorf, after Bekker.
2645	But some found fault with him especially because, whereas it had been the custom for the bodyguard to be drawn from Italy,

2681	This man was the best of the Caesarians attending upon Severus, had been trusted with his opinions, and had been assigned the duties of chamberlain.
2682	Also he spent a great deal uselessly upon renovating and repairing other places, erecting, for instance, to Bacchus and Hercules a temple of huge size.
2683	Antoninus had first had the desire to murder his brother while his father was still alive, but had been unable to do so at that time because of Severus, or later, on the road, because of the legions.

2691	He had Alexander on the brain to such an extent that he used certain weapons and cups which purported to have belonged to the great conqueror, and furthermore he set up many representations of him both among the legions and in Rome itself.

2709	And he reproved the senate, saying for one thing that they were slothful, did not understand readily, and did not give their votes separately.
2710	But, as he was disliked there, he was driven out of Rome and went to Lugdunum, where he delighted the people, who were rather provincial.
2711	But when he reached the suburbs whither the leading citizens had come with certain mystic and sacred symbols, he greeted them as if he intended to entertain them at a banquet and then put them to death.
2712	After this he arrayed his whole force in armor and marched into the city; he had sent previous notice to all the people there to remain at home and had occupied all the streets and in addition all the roofs in advance.

2741	And Lucius Priscillianus whose name was presented by the senate itself, was as much renowned for his insulting behavior as he was for his killing of wild beasts.
